- all indentation is tabs (set to 8 char) with the exception of
  continuation lines that are alligned with tabs and then spaces

- all keywords followed by a '(' have a space in between

	if (condition)

	for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)

- function calls do NOT have a space between their name and argument

	i = some_function(argument);

- usually there is no space on the inside of parenthesis (see examples
  above)

- function / method implementations have their opening curly braces in
  column 1

- all other opening curly braces follow at the end of the line, with a
  space separating them:

	if (condition) {
		dosomething();
	}

- both sides of an if / else clause either use or do not use curly braces:

	if (condition)
		i = 4;
	else
		j = 6;

	if (condition) {
		i = 6;
	} else {
		i = 4;
		j = 6;
	}

- use space to make visual separation easier

	a = b + 3 + e / 4;

- continuation lines have the operator / comma at the end

	if (very_long_conditiont_1 ||
	    condition_2)

	b = a + (c + d +
		 f + z);

- in a C++ constructor initialization list, the colon is on the same line and
  continuation lines are aligned as the rule above:

	ClassName::ClassName() : x(1), y(2),
				 z(3)
	{
	}

- unfortunate inconsistency:
  -- C code usually uses underscores to structure names

	variable_in_C

  -- C++ code usually uses camelCase

	variableInCPlusPlus

  where the two meet, use your best judgment and go for best consistency
  (i.e., where does the variable "originate")

- switch statements with blocks are a little bit special (to avoid indenting
  too far)

	switch (foo) {
	case FIRST:
		whatever();
		break;
	case SECOND: {
		int i;
		for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
			do_something(i);
	}
	}
