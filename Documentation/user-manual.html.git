<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Manual authors</strong>: Willem Ferguson, Jacco van Koll, Dirk Hohndel, Reinout Hoornweg,

<div class="paragraph"><p><span class="blue"><em>Version 4.2,  August 2014</em></span></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Welcome as a user of <em>Subsurface</em>, an advanced dive logging program with
extensive infrastructure to describe, organise, interpret and print scuba
and free dives. <em>Subsurface</em> offers many advantages over other similar
software solutions:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Do you use two different dive computer brands, each with its own proprietary
   software for downloading dive logs? Do you dive with rebreathers as well
   as open circuit? Do you use a Reefnet Sensus time-depth recorder
   in conjunction with a dive computer? <em>Subsurface</em> offers a standard
   interface for downloading dive logs from all these different pieces of
   equipment and to store and analyse the dive logs within a unified system.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Do you use more than one operating system? <em>Subsurface</em> is fully compatible
   with Mac, Linux and Windows, allowing you to access your dive log on each
   of your operating systems with a single application.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Do you use Linux or Mac and your dive computer has only Windows-based software
   for downloading dive information (e.g. Mares)? <em>Subsurface</em> provides a way of
   storing and analysing your dive logs on other operating systems.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Subsurface</em> binaries are available for Windows PCs (Win XP or later), Intel
based Macs (OS/X) and many Linux distributions. <em>Subsurface</em> can be built for
many more hardware platforms and software environments where Qt and
libdivecomputer are available.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The scope of this document is the use of the <em>Subsurface</em> program. To install
the software, consult the <em>Downloads</em> page on the
<a href="http://subsurface-divelog.org/"><em>Subsurface</em> web site</a>.
Please discuss issues with this program by sending an email to
<a href="mailto:subsurface@subsurface-divelog.org">our mailing list</a> and report bugs at
<a href="http://trac.hohndel.org">our bugtracker</a>.  For instructions on how to build the
software and (if needed) its dependencies please consult the INSTALL file
included with the source code.</p></div>

<h2 id="S_UserSurvey">1. The user survey</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>In order to develop <em>Subsurface</em> in a way that serves its users in the best possible way,
it is important to have some user information. Upon launching <em>Subsurface</em>
after using this software for a week or so, a one-box user survey pops up. It is entirely
optional and the user controls what, if any, data are sent to the <em>Subsurface</em> development
team. Any data that the user chooses to send is extremely useful, and will only be
used to steer future development and to customise the software to fit the needs of
the <em>Subsurface</em> users. If one completes the survey, or clicks the option not to
be asked again, that should be the last communication of this nature one receives.
However, if one&#8217;s diving and/or subsurface habits change and one wishes to provide
another survey, this can be done by launching <em>Subsurface</em> with the <em>--survey</em> option on the
command line.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="S_StartUsing">2. Start Using the Program</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <em>Subsurface</em> window is usually divided into four panels with a <strong>Main
Menu</strong> (File Import Log View Filter Help) at the top of the window (for Windows
and Linux) or the top of the screen (for Mac and Ubuntu Unity). The four panels are:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
The <strong>Dive List</strong> to the bottom left containing a list of all the dives in the
user&#8217;s
dive log. A dive can be selected and highlighted on the dive list by clicking on
it. In most situations the up/down keys can be used to switch
between dives. The <strong>Dive List</strong> is an important tool for manipulating a dive log.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <strong>Dive Map</strong> to the bottom right, showing the user&#8217;s dive sites on a world
map
and centred on the site of the last dive selected in the <strong>Dive List</strong>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <strong>Dive Info</strong> to the top left, giving more detailed information on the
dive selected in the <strong>Dive List</strong>, including some statistics for the selected dive or for all
highlighted dive(s).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <strong>Dive Profile</strong> to the top right, showing a graphical dive profile of the
selected dive in the <strong>Dive List</strong>.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The dividers between panels can be dragged in order to change the size of any of
the panels. <em>Subsurface</em> remembers the position of the dividers, so the next
time <em>Subsurface</em> starts it uses the positions of the dividers from when the program
was last used.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If a dive is selected in the <strong>Dive List</strong>, the dive location, detailed information
and profile of
the <em>selected dive</em> are shown in the respective panels. On the other hand, if
one highlights more than one dive the last highlighted dive is the <em>selected
dive</em>, but summary data of all <em>highlighted dives</em> are shown in the <strong>Stats</strong> tab
of the <strong>Dive Info</strong> panel (maximum, minimum and average depths, durations, water
temperatures and SAC; total time and number of dives selected).</p></div>

shortcut keys they are not listed here in the user manual.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When the program is started for the first time, it shows no information at all.
This is because the program doesn&#8217;t have any dive information available. In the
following sections, the procedures to create a new logbook will be described.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="S_NewLogbook">3. Creating a new logbook</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Select <em>File &#8594; New Logbook</em> from the main menu. All existing dive data are
cleared so that new information can be added. If there are unsaved data in an
open logbook, the user is asked whether the open logbook should be
saved before a new logbook is created.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="S_GetInformation">4. How to store dive information in the user&#8217;s logbook</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are several ways in which dive information can be added to a logbook:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
Enter dive information by hand. This is typically useful if the diver did not
use a dive computer and dives were recorded in a written logbook.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Import dive information directly from a dive computer if it is supported by
<em>Subsurface</em>. The latest list of dive computers supported by <em>Subsurface</em> can
be found at:
<a href="http://subsurface-divelog.org/documentation/supported-dive-computers/">
Supported dive computers</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Import dive information from another database or file format. If you
have kept your dive logs with other log software, these logs can often
be imported to subsurface. This is discussed in more detail below.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="S_EnterData">4.1. Entering dive information by hand</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is usually the approach for dives without a dive computer. The basic record
of information within <em>Subsurface</em> is a dive. The most important information
in a simple dive logbook usually includes dive type, date, time, duration,
depth, the names of your dive buddy and of the dive master or dive guide, and
some remarks about the dive. <em>Subsurface</em> can store much more information
than this for each dive. In order to add a dive to a dive log, select <em>Log
&#8594; Add Dive</em> from the Main Menu. The program then shows three panels to enter
information for a dive: two tabs in the <strong>Dive Info</strong> panel (<strong>Dive Notes</strong> and
<strong>Equipment</strong>), as well as the <strong>Dive Profile</strong> panel that displays a graphical profile
of each dive. These panels are respectively marked <span class="red">A</span>, <span class="red">B</span> and
<span class="red">C</span>
in the figure below. Each of these tabs will now be explained for data entry.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/AddDive1.jpg" alt="FIGURE: Add dive" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When one edits a field in Dive notes or Equipment panels, <em>Subsurface</em> enters <strong>Editing Mode</strong>,
indicated by the message in the blue box at the top of the <em>Dive Notes</em> panel. This message is
displayed in all the panels under Dive notes and Equipment when in <strong>Editing Mode</strong>.</p></div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_dive_notes">4.1.1. Dive Notes</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This panel contains the date, time and place information for a particular dive,
environmental conditions, co-divers and buddies, as well as some descriptive
information. If one clicks on the <strong>Dive Notes</strong> tab, the following
fields are visible:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/AddDive2.jpg" alt="FIGURE: The Dive Notes tab" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>Time</strong> field reflects the date and the time of the dive. By clicking
the date, a calendar is displayed from which
one can choose the correct date. Press ESC to escape from the calendar.
The time values (hour and minutes) can also be
edited directly by clicking on each of them in the text box and by overtyping the
information displayed. The default date is the present date and the default time is
an hour in advance of the present time.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Air and water temperatures</strong>: the air and water temperatures during the
dive can be typed directly on the fields to the right of the Start time.
Temperature units are not needed, as they will be automatically supplied by
<em>Subsurface</em>. Only the numerical value must be
typed by the user (the units selected in the <em>Preferences</em>
will determine whether metric or imperial units are used).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Location</strong>: Here the name of the dive site can be entered, e.g. "Tihany, Lake
Balaton,
Hungary". Auto completion of location names will make this easier if one
frequently dives at the same sites.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Coordinates</strong>: The geographic coordinates of the dive site should be entered
here. These can come from three sources:</p></div>
<div class="olist loweralpha"><ol class="loweralpha">
<li>
<p>
One can find the coordinates on the world map in the bottom right hand
part
of the Subsurface window. The map displays a green bar indicating "No location
data - Move the map and double-click to set the dive location". Upon a double-click
at the appropriate place, the green bar disappears and the coordinates are
stored.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The coordinates can be obtained from the <em>Subsurface</em> Companion app if the
user has an Android device with GPS and if the coordinates of the dive site
were stored using that device.
<a href="#S_Companion">Click here for more information</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The coordinates can be entered by hand if they are known, using one of
four formats with latitude followed by longitude:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>ISO 6709 Annex D format e.g. 30°13'28.9"N 30°49'1.5"E
Degrees and decimal minutes, e.g. N30° 13.49760' , E30° 49.30788'
Degrees minutes seconds, e.g. N30° 13' 29.8" , E30° 49' 1.5"
Decimal degrees, e.g. 30.22496 , 30.821798</code></pre>
</div></div>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Southern hemisphere latitudes are given with a <strong>S</strong>, e.g. S30°, or with a
negative value, e.g. -30.22496. Similarly western longitudes are given with a
<strong>W</strong>, e.g. W07°, or with a negative value, e.g. -7.34323.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Please note that GPS coordinates of a dive site are linked to the Location
name - so adding coordinates to dives that do not have a location description
will cause unexpected behaviour (Subsurface will think that all of these
dives have the same location and try to keep their GPS coordinates the
same).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Divemaster</strong>: The name of the dive master or dive guide for this dive can be
entered here.
Again, this field offers auto completion based on the list of dive masters in
the current logbook.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Buddy</strong>: In this field one can enter the name(s) of the buddy / buddies
(separated by commas) who accompanied the user on the dive. Auto completion
is offered based on the list of buddies in the current logbook.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Suit</strong>: The type of diving suit used for the dive can be entered here.
As with the other items, auto completion of the suit description is available.
Some dry-suit users may choose to use this field to record what combination of
suit and thermal protection undersuit was used.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Rating</strong>: One can provide a subjective overall rating of the dive on a
5-point scale by clicking the appropriate star on the rating scale.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Visibility</strong>: Similarly, one can provide a rating of visibility during the
dive on a
5-point scale by clicking the appropriate star.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Tags</strong>: Tags that describe the type of dive performed may
be entered here (separated by commas). Examples of common tags are boat, drift,
training, cave etc. <em>Subsurface</em> has many built-in tags. Auto completion is once again offered.
For instance, if <code>cav</code> was typed, then the tags <strong>cave</strong> and <strong>cavern</strong> are
shown for the user to choose from.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Notes</strong>: Any additional information can be typed here.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Cancel</strong> buttons are used to save all the information for tabs in
the info panel and in the dive profile panel, so there&#8217;s no need to use them
until ALL other information has been added. Here is an example of a completed
Dive Notes panel:</p></div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_equipment">4.1.2. Equipment</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Equipment tab allows the user to enter information about the type of
cylinder and gas used, as well as the weights used for a dive. This is a highly interactive part of
<em>Subsurface</em> and the information on
cylinders and gases (entered here) affects the behaviour of the dive profile
(top right-hand panel).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph" id="S_CylinderData"><p><strong>Cylinders</strong>: The cylinder information is entered through a dialogue that looks
like this:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/Gas_dialogue1.jpg" alt="FIGURE:Initial cylinder dialogue" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The + button at the top right allows the user to add more cylinders for this
dive.
The dark dustbin icon on the left allows one to delete information for a
particular cylinder. Note that it is not possible to delete a cylinder if it is used during the
dive. One cylinder is implicitly used in the dive, even without a gas change event. Thus the first
cylinder cannot be deleted until another cylinder is created.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Start by selecting a cylinder type on the left-hand side of the
table.  To select a cylinder, click in the <strong>Type</strong> box.
This brings up a button that can be used to display a dropdown list of
cylinders:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/Gas_dialogue2.jpg" alt="FIGURE:The cylinder drop-down list button" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The drop-down list can be used to select the cylinder type used
for the dive or the user may start typing in the box which shows the
available options for the entered characters. The
<strong>Size</strong> of the cylinder as well as its working pressure (<strong>WorkPress</strong>) will
automatically be shown in the dialogue. If a cylinder is not shown in the dropdown list,
type the name and description of that cylinder into the <strong>Type</strong> field.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Next, indicate the starting pressure and the ending pressure of
the
gas used during the dive. The unit of pressure (metric/imperial) corresponds
to the setting in the <em>Preferences</em>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Finally, type in the gas mixture used in the <strong>O2%</strong> field. If air
was used, a value of 21% can be entered on this field,  or it might be
left blank. If nitrox or trimix were used, their percentages of oxygen and/or
helium must be specified.
Any inappropriate fields should be left empty. After typing the information for
the cylinder, press <em>ENTER</em> on the keyboard or click
outside the cell that contains the cursor. Information for any additional
cylinders can be added by using the + button at the top right hand. Following
is an example of a complete description for a
dive made using two cylinders (air and EAN50):</p></div>

<div class="content">
<img src="images/CylinderDataEntry3.jpg" alt="FIGURE: a completed cylinder dive information table" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Weights</strong>: Information about the weight system used during a dive can be entered
using a dialogue very similar to that for the cylinder information. If the user
clicks the + button on the top right of the weights dialogue, the table looks
like this:</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The drop-down list can then be used to select the type of weight system or the user may start
typing in the box which shows the available options for the entered characters. In
the <strong>Weight</strong>
field, the weight used during the dive must be typed. After typing the
information
for the weight system the user must either press <em>ENTER</em> on the keyboard or
click outside the
cell that contains the cursor. It is possible to enter
information for more than one weight system by adding an additional system using
the + button on the top right hand. Weight systems can be deleted using the
dustbin icon on the left hand. Here is an example of information for a dive
with two types of weights: integrated and a weight belt:</p></div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="S_CreateProfile">4.1.3. Creating a Dive Profile</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>Dive Profile</strong> (a graphical representation of the depth of the dive as a
function of time) is indicated in the panel on the top right hand of the
<em>Subsurface</em> window. When a dive is manually added to a logbook, <em>Subsurface</em>
presents a default dive profile that needs to be modified to best represent the
dive being described:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/DiveProfile1.jpg" alt="FIGURE: Initial dive profile" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Modifying the dive profile</em>: When the cursor is moved around the dive profile,
its position is indicated by two coloured lines (red and green) as shown below.
The depth and time
that the cursor represents are indicated at the top of the black information box
(@ and D). The units (metric/imperial) on the axes are determined by the
<strong>Preference</strong> settings. The dive profile itself comprises several
line segments demarcated by waypoints (white dots on the profile, as shown
above). The default dive depth is 15 m.
If the dive depth was 20 m then the user needs to drag the appropriate waypoints
downwards to represent 20 m. To add a waypoint, double-click on
any line segment. To move an additional waypoint, drag it.
To remove this waypoint, right-click on it and choose "Remove this point" from the
context menu. The user needs to drag the waypoints to represent an
accurate
time duration for the dive. Below is a dive profile that represents a dive
to 20 m for 30 min, followed by a 5 minute safety stop at 5 m.</p></div>

along the line segments of the dive profile. This defaults to the first gas
mixture specified in the <strong>Equipment</strong> tab, which was air in the case of the
profile illustrated above. The gas mixtures of segments of the dive profile can
be edited. This is done by right-clicking on the particular
waypoint and selecting the appropriate gas from the context menu. Changing
the gas for a waypoint affects the gas shown in the segment <em>to the left</em> of
that
waypoint. Note that only the gases defined in the <strong>Equipment</strong> tab appear in the

<div class="paragraph"><p>To import dive information from a dive computer to a computer with
<em>Subsurface</em>,
it is necessary that the two pieces of equipment communicate with one another.
This
involves setting up the communications port (or mount point) of the computer
with <em>Subsurface</em> that communicates with the dive computer. In order to set up
this communication, one needs to find the appropriate information to
instruct
<em>Subsurface</em> where and how to import the dive information.
<a href="#_appendix_a_operating_system_specific_information_for_importing_dive_information_from_a_dive_computer">Appendix A</a>

achieved by following these steps:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
The interface cable should be connected to a free USB port (or the Infra-red
        or Bluetooth connection set up as described later in this manual)
</p>

<li>
<p>
The dive computer should be placed into PC Communication mode.
        (Users should refer to the manual of their specific dive computer)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In <em>Subsurface</em>, from the Main Menu, the user must select <em>Import &#8594; Import
From Dive Computer</em>.
Dialogue <strong>A</strong> in the figure below appears:

</ol></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ImportFromDC1.jpg" alt="FIGURE: Download dialogue 1" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Dive computers tend to keep a certain number of dives in their memory, even
though these dives have already been imported to <em>Subsurface</em>. For that reason
<em>Subsurface</em> only imports dives that have not been uploaded before. This makes
the download process faster on most dive computers and also saves battery power
of the dive computer (at least for those not charging while connected via USB).
If, for some reason, the user wishes to import ALL dives from the dive computer,
even though some may already be in the logbook, then check the check box labelled
<em>Force download of all dives</em>.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The dialogue has two drop-down lists, <strong>Vendor</strong> and <strong>Dive Computer</strong>. On the
<strong>vendor</strong> drop-down list select the make of the computer, e.g.
Suunto, Oceanic,
Uwatec, Mares. On the <strong>Dive Computer</strong> drop-down list, the model name of
the dive computer must be selected, e.g. D4 (Suunto), Veo200 (Oceanic), or Puck
(Mares).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <strong>Device or Mount Point</strong> drop-down list contains the USB or Bluetooth port
name that <em>Subsurface</em> needs in order to communicate with the dive computer.
The appropriate port name must be selected. Consult
<a href="#_appendix_a_operating_system_specific_information_for_importing_dive_information_from_a_dive_computer">Appendix A</a>
and
<a href="#_appendix_b_dive_computer_specific_information_for_importing_dive_information">Appendix B</a>
for technical details on how to find the appropriate port information for a
particular dive
computer and, in some cases, how to do the correct settings to the operating
system of the computer on which <em>Subsurface</em> is running.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If all the dives on the dive computer need to be downloaded, check the
   checkbox <em>Force download of all dives</em>. Normally, <em>Subsurface</em> only downloads
   dives after the date-time of the last dive in the <strong>Dive List</strong> panel. If one
   or more of your dives in <em>Subsurface</em> have been accidentally deleted or if there
   are older dives that still need to be downloaded from the dive computer, this
   checkbox needs to be activated. Some dive computers (e.g. Mares Puck) do not provide
   a contents list to <em>Subsurface</em> before the download in order to select only new dives.
   Consequently, for these dive computers, all dives are downloaded
   irrespective of the status of this check box.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If the checkbox <em>Always prefer downloaded dives</em>
   has been checked and, during download, dives with identical date-times exist on
   the dive computer and on the <em>Subsurface</em>
   <strong>Dive List</strong> panel, the record in the <em>Subsurface</em> divelog will be overwritten
   by the record from the dive computer
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Do <strong>not</strong> check the checkboxes labelled <em>Save libdivecomputer logfile</em> and
    <em>Save libdivecomputer dumpfile</em>. These are only used as diagnostic tools
    when problems with downloads are experienced (see below).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <em>OK</em> button must then be clicked. Dialogue <strong>B</strong> in the figure above
appears.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
With communication established, one can see how the data are
retrieved from the dive computer.
Depending on the make of the dive computer and/or number of recorded dives, this
could take some time. The user should be patient. The <em>Download</em> dialogue
shows a
progress bar at the bottom of the dialogue (for some dive computers the
progress information could be inaccurate as we cannot determine how much
downloadable data there is until all data have been downloaded). When the
download of the dive information is complete, all the imported dives appear
in the <strong>Dive List</strong>, sorted by date and time. Disconnect and
switch off the dive
computer to conserve its battery power.
If a particular dive is selected, the <strong>Dive Profile</strong> panel shows an informative
graph of dive depth against time for that particular dive.
</p>
</li>
<li>

<h4 id="S_DeviceNames">4.2.2. Changing the name of a dive computer</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It may be necessary to distinguish between different dive computers used to
upload dive logs to <em>Subsurface</em>. For instance if one&#8217;s partner&#8217;s dive computer is the
same make and model as one&#8217;s own and dive logs are uploaded from both dive computers
to the same <em>Subsurface</em> computer, then
one would perhaps like to call one dc "Alice&#8217;s Suunto D4" and the other one
"Bob&#8217;s Suunto D4". Alternatively, perhaps a technical diver dives with two or more
dive computers of the same model, the logs of both (or all) being uploaded.
In this case it might be prudent to call one of them
"Suunto D4 (1)" and another one "Suunto D4 (2)". This is easily done in <em>Subsurface</em>.
On the <strong>Main Menu</strong>, select <em>Log &#8594; Edit device names</em>. A dialog opens, indicating the
current Model, ID and Nickname of the dive computers used for upload. Edit the Nickname
field for the appropriate dive computer. After saving the Nickname, the dive logs
show the nickname for that particular device instead of the model name,
allowing easy identification of devices.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="S_EditDiveInfo">4.2.3. Updating the dive information imported from the dive computer.</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The information from the dive computer is not complete and more
details must be added in order to have a fuller record of the dives. To
do this,
the <strong>Dive Notes</strong> and the <strong>Equipment</strong> tabs on the top left hand of the
<em>Subsurface</em> window should be used.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_dive_notes_2">4.2.4. Dive Notes</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The date and time of the dive, gas mixture and (often) water temperature is
shown as obtained from the dive computer, but the user needs to add some
additional information by hand in order to have a more complete dive record.
If the contents of this tab is changed or edited in any way, the message in a blue box at
the top of the panel indicates that the dive is being edited. If one
clicks on the <strong>Dive Notes</strong> tab, the following fields are
visible:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/AddDive3.jpg" alt="FIGURE: The Dive Notes tab" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>Time</strong> field reflects the date and time of the dive. By clicking
the date, a calendar is displayed from which
one can choose the correct date. Press ESC to close the calendar.
The time values (hour and minutes) can also be
edited directly by clicking on each of them in the text box and by overtyping the
information displayed.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Air/water temperatures</strong>: Air and water temperatures during the dive are shown
in these fields to the right of the Start time. Many dive computers supply water
temperature information and this field may therefore contain information obtained from the dive computer.
If air temperature is not provided by the dive computer, the first temperature reading
might be used for the air temperature. Generally this is close enough to the real air temperature as
the change in the temperature sensor reading is quite slow to follow the changes in the environment.
If editing is required, only a value is required, the units of temperature will be
automatically supplied by
<em>Subsurface</em> (according to the <em>Preferences</em>, metric or imperial units will
be used).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Location</strong>: In this field one should type in text that describes the site
where the dive was performed, e.g. "Tihany, Lake Balaton, Hungary".
Auto completion of location names will
make this easier if one frequently dives at the same sites.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Coordinates</strong>: The geographic coordinates of the dive site should be entered
here. These can come from three sources:</p></div>
<div class="olist loweralpha"><ol class="loweralpha">
<li>
<p>
The user can find the coordinates on the world map in the bottom right hand
part
of the Subsurface window. The map displays a green bar indicating "Move the map
and double-click to set the dive location". Double-click
at the appropriate place, the green bar disappears and the coordinates are
stored.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The user can obtain the coordinates from the <em>Subsurface</em> Companion app if
an Android device with GPS was used and if the coordinates of the dive site
were stored using that device.
<a href="#S_Companion">Click here for more information</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The coordinates can be entered by hand if they are known, using one of
four formats with latitude followed by longitude:

</div></div>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Southern hemisphere latitudes are given with a <strong>S</strong>, e.g. S30°, or with a

<strong>W</strong>, e.g. W07°, or with a negative value, e.g. -7.34323.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Please note that GPS coordinates of a dive site are linked to the Location
name - so adding coordinates to dives that do not have a location description
will cause unexpected behaviour (Subsurface will think that all of these
dives have the same location and try to keep their GPS coordinates the
same).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Divemaster</strong>: The name of the dive master or dive guide for this dive should be
entered in this field
which offers auto completion based on the list of dive masters in
the current logbook.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Buddy</strong>: In this field, one enters the name(s) of the buddy / buddies
(separated with commas) who accompanied him/her on the
dive. Auto completion based on the list of buddies in the current logbook is
offered.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Suit</strong>: Here the type of diving suit used for the dive can be entered.
Auto completion of the suit description is available.
Some dry-suit users may choose to use this field to record what combination of
suit and thermal protection undersuit was used.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Rating</strong>: One can provide a subjective overall rating of the dive on a
5-point scale by clicking the appropriate star on the rating scale.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Visibility</strong>: Similarly, one can provide a rating of visibility during the
dive on a
5-point scale by clicking the appropriate star.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Tags</strong>: Tags that describe the type of dive performed can be entered
here (separated by commas). Examples of common tags are boat, drift, training,
cave, etc.
<em>Subsurface</em> has many built-in tags. If the user starts typing a tag, the
program
will list the tags that correspond to the typing. For instance, if the user
typed
<code>cav</code>, then the tags <strong>cave</strong> and <strong>cavern</strong> are shown for the user to choose from.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Notes</strong>: Any additional information for the dive can be entered here.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Cancel</strong> buttons are used to save all the information for tabs
in the info panel and in the dive profile panel, so there&#8217;s no need to use them
until ALL other information has been added. Here is an example of a completed
Dive Notes panel:</p></div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>indicates that the dive is being edited. This is a highly interactive part of
<em>Subsurface</em> and the information on
cylinders and gases (entered here) determines the behaviour of the dive profile
(top right-hand panel).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Cylinders</strong>: The cylinder information is entered through a dialogue that looks
like this:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/DC_gas_dialogue1.jpg" alt="FIGURE: Initial cylinder dialogue" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In most cases <em>Subsurface</em> obtains the gas used from the dive computer and
automatically inserts the gas composition(% oxygen) in the table. The + button
at the top right allows the user to add more cylinders for this dive. The dark
dustbin icon on the left allows the deletion of information for a cylinder.
Note that it is not possible to delete a cylinder if it is used during the
dive. A cylinder might be implicitly used in the dive, even without a gas change event.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The user should start by selecting a cylinder type on the left-hand side of the
table.  To select a cylinder, the <strong>cylinder type</strong> box should be clicked. This
brings up a list button that can be used to display a dropdown list of
cylinders:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/DC_gas_dialogue2.jpg" alt="FIGURE: The cylinder drop-down list button" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The drop-down list can then be used to select the cylinder type that was used
for this dive or the user may start typing in the box which shows the available
options for the entered characters. The
<strong>Size</strong> of the cylinder as well as its working pressure (<strong>WorkPress</strong>) will
automatically be shown in the dialogue.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Next one must indicate the starting pressure and the ending pressure of the
specified gas during the dive. The unit of pressure (metric/imperial)
corresponds to the settings chosen in the <em>Preferences</em>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Finally, provide the gas mixture used. If air was used, the
value of 21%  can be entered  or this field can be left blank. If nitrox or
trimix were used, their percentages of oxygen and/or helium should be entered.
Any inappropriate fields should be left empty. After typing the
information for the cylinder,
either press <em>ENTER</em> on the keyboard or click outside the cell
that contains
the cursor. Information for any additional cylinders can be added by using the<br />
button at the top right hand. Following is an example of a complete description
for a dive using two cylinders (air and EAN50):</p></div>

clicks
the + button on the top right of the weights dialogue, the table looks like
this:</p></div>

In the <strong>Weight</strong>
field, type in the amount of weight used during the dive. After
specifying the weight
system, the user can either press <em>ENTER</em> on the keyboard or click outside the
cell with the cursor.
It is possible to enter information for more than one weight system by adding
an additional system

<h4 id="_editing_several_selected_dives_simultaneously">4.2.6. Editing several selected dives simultaneously</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>METHOD 1</em>: After uploading dives from
a dive computer, the dive profiles of the uploaded dives are shown in the <strong>Dive profile</strong> tab, as well
as a few items of information
in the <strong>Dive Notes</strong> tab (e.g. water temperature) and in the <strong>Equipment</strong> tab (e.g. gas pressures
and gas composition). However the other fields remain empty.
It may be useful to simultaneously edit some of the
fields in the <strong>Dive Notes</strong> and <strong>Equipment</strong> tabs.  For instance, it is possible
that a diver performed several dives during a single day, using identical equipment while diving at the same
dive site or with the same dive master and/or buddy or tags. Instead of completing the information for each
of these dives separately, one can select all the dives for that day in the <strong>Dive List</strong> and
insert the same information in the <strong>Dive Notes</strong> and <strong>Equipment</strong> fields that need
identical information. This is achieved by editing the dive notes or the equipment for any one
of the selected dives.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The simultaneous editing only works with fields that do not already contain information.
This means that, if some fields have been edited for a particular dive among the selected dives,
these are not changed while
editing the dives simultaneously. Technically, the rule for editing several dives simultaneously is:
if the data field being edited contains <em>exactly the same information</em> for all the dives that have been
selected, the new, edited information is substituted for all the selected dives, otherwise only the
edited dive is
changed, even though several dives have been selected in the <strong>Dive List</strong>. This greatly speeds
up the completion of the dive log after several similar dives.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph" id="S_CopyComponents"><p><em>METHOD 2</em>:There is a different way of achieving the same goal. Select a dive with all the appropriate information
typed into the <strong>Dive Notes</strong> and <strong>Equipment</strong> tabs. Then, from the main menu, select <em>Log &#8594; Copy dive components</em>.
A box is presented with a selection of check boxes for most of the fields in the <strong>Dive Notes</strong> and <strong>Equipment</strong> tabs.
Select the fields to be copied from the currently selected dive, then select <em>OK</em>. Now, in the <strong>Dive List</strong>,
select the dives
into which this information is to be pasted. Then, from the main menu, select <em>Log &#8594; Paste dive components</em>. All the selected dives now contain the data initially selected in the original source dive log.</p></div>

done:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Right-click at the appropriate point on the dive profile.
This brings up the dive profile context menu. Select <em>Add bookmark</em>. A red flag is
placed on the dive profile at the point that was initially selected (see <strong>A</strong> below).

<div class="paragraph" id="S_ImportingAlienDiveLogs"><p>If a user has been diving for some time, it is possible that several dives were
logged using other dive log software. This information does not need retyping
because these dive logs can probably be
imported into <em>Subsurface</em>. <em>Subsurface</em> will import dive logs from a range of
other
dive log software. While some software is supported natively, for others the
user has to
export the logbook(s) to an intermediate format so that they can then be imported
by <em>Subsurface</em>.
Currently, <em>Subsurface</em> supports importing CSV log files from several sources.
APD LogViewer, XP5, Sensus and Seabear files are
preconfigured, but because the import is flexible, users can configure their own
imports.
Manually kept log files (e.g. in spreadsheet) can also be imported by
configuring the CSV import.
<em>Subsurface</em> can also import UDDF and UDCF files used by some divelog
software and some dive computers, like the Heinrichs &amp; Weikamp DR5. Finally,
for some divelog software like Mares Dive Organiser it is currently suggested to
import the logbooks first into a webservice like <em>divelogs.de</em> and then import
them from there with
<em>Subsurface</em>, as divelogs.de supports a few additional logbook formats that
<em>Subsurface</em> currently cannot parse.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If the format of other software is supported natively on Subsurface, it should be sufficient to select
either <em>Import&#8594;Import log files</em> or <em>File&#8594;Open log file</em>. <em>Subsurface</em> supports the data formats
of many dive computers, including Suunto and Shearwater. When importing dives, <em>Subsurface</em>
tries to detect multiple records for
the same dive and merges the information as best as it can. If
there are no time zone issues (or other reasons that would cause the
beginning time of the dives to be significantly different) <em>Subsurface</em>
will not create duplicate entries.</p></div>

dive computer, a CCR system computer does not allow the download of a log

<h4 id="S_ImportingCSV">4.3.5. Importing dives in CSV format</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Sometimes dive computers export dive information as files with
<em>comma-separated values</em> (.CSV). For example, the APD Inspiration and Evolution
closed circuit rebreather (CCR) systems export dive information in a CSV
formatted file that normally contains information for a single dive only. These
files can easily be imported into <em>Subsurface</em>.
CSV files are normally organised into
a single line that provides the headers of the data columns, followed by the
data, one record per line. CSV files can be opened with a normal text editor.
Following is a highly simplified and shortened example of a CSV file from an
APD rebreather:</p></div>
<div class="literalblock">

<div class="paragraph"><p>Note that each title may comprise more than one word; for instance
<em>Dive Time (s)</em> in the above data example. Before being able to import the data
to <em>Subsurface</em> one first needs to know:</p></div>
<div class="olist loweralpha"><ol class="loweralpha">
<li>
<p>
Which character separates the different columns within a single line of
data? This field separator should be either a comma (,) or a TAB character.
This can be determined by opening the file with a text editor. If it is
comma-delimited, then the comma
characters between the values are clearly visible. If no commas are evident and
the numbers are aligned in columns,
the file is probably TAB-delimited (i.e. it uses a TAB as a field separator, as
in the above example).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Which data columns need to be imported into <em>Subsurface</em>? The Dive Time and
Depth columns are always required. Open the file using a text editor and note
the titles of the columns to be imported and their column positions. For
instance for the above example:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>Time:           column 1
Depth:          column 2
Temperature:    column 5
pO₂:          column 4</code></pre>
</div></div>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Armed with this information, importing the data into <em>Subsurface</em> is
straightforward. Select
<em>Import&#8594;Import Log Files</em> from the main menu. In the resulting file
selection menu, select <em>CSV files</em>, after which a common configuration dialog
appears for all the
files with a CSV extension:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/Import_CSV1.jpg" alt="FIGURE: CSV download dialogue" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are pre-configured definitions for some dive computers, e.g. the APD
rebreathers. If the user&#8217;s dive computer is on this list, it should be selected
using the dropdown
box labeled <em>Pre-configured imports</em>. Select the button at the bottom right
to indicate whether the dive data are in metric of imperial units.
Finally <em>OK</em> should be clicked and
the dive will be imported and listed in the <strong>Dive List</strong> tab of <em>Subsurface</em>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If the dive computer is not on the pre-configured list, the user must
select the <em>Field
Separator</em> (TAB or comma) for the particular CSV file, using the appropriate
dropdown list. and indicate which columns in the CSV file
contain which data
variables. For each data column used for import, the user must check the
appropriate check box
and indicate in which column these data are found. For instance, the image above
corresponds to the dialogue that would apply to the CSV data set described above
the image. After completing the column specification, select the <em>OK</em> button

<div class="paragraph"><p>If one keeps dive logs in a spreadsheet, there is an option to import
those dives as well. Spreadsheet data, exported as a CSV file, can
be imported to <em>Subsurface</em>. When importing manually
kept log files, the information needed is quite different as we are
importing only metadata, not profile samples.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Similarly to importing dives in CSV format (see above), one needs to
know the internal format
of the CSV data to import.</p></div>
<div class="olist loweralpha"><ol class="loweralpha">
<li>
<p>
Which character separates the different columns within a single line of
data? This
should be either a comma (,), semicolon (;) or a TAB
character, and could be determined by opening the file with a text
editor. If it is comma-delimited, then the comma
characters between the values are clearly visible. If no commas are evident and
the data
are in clear columns, the file
is probably TAB-delimited (i.e. it uses a TAB as a field separator, as in the
above example).
A recommended field separator for the export is tab, as commas might be part of
the
field values themselves. Therefore the use of an appropriate field separator
in very important.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Which columns need to be imported into <em>Subsurface</em>? We do not
currently have any mandatory input fields, but some, e.g. dive duration
are crucial for the log file to make any sense. Possible options
can be seen in the image below and one should include all the
fields available in both your log file and in the <em>Subsurface</em>
import.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Units used for depth, weight and temperature. We consider depth to be
either feet or meters, weight kilograms or pounds and temperature either
Celsius or Fahrenheit. However, the users can select <em>Metric</em> or
<em>Imperial</em> in the <em>Preferences</em> tab of <em>Subsurface</em>. No mixture of unit
systems is allowed for the different fields.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Importing manually kept CSV log files is quite straight forward, but
there might be many fields and counting the field numbers is error
prone. Therefore validation of the data to be imported is critical.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To import the dives, select <em>Import&#8594;Import Log Files</em> from the menu
bar. If the CSV option in the dropdown list is selected and the file list
includes file names ending with .CSV, one can select the

on agreement of the date-time information between these two devices. Although <em>Subsurface</em> has
a wide range tolerance, it may be unable to identify the appropriate dive if there is
a large difference between the time in the dive computer and that of the Android device,

<div class="paragraph"><p>Similar date-times may not always be possible and there may be many reasons for this (e.g. time zones), or

dives while running <em>background service</em> there may be several locations that would be
included in the time range that fit not only the first dive, but one or more subsequent dives as well).

<em>Background service</em>, being a very powerful tool, may fill the location list with
many unnecessary locations not corresponding to the exact dive point but reflecting the boat&#8217;s route.
Currently these locations are difficult to delete from the server. In some situations it
is therefore prudent to clean up the list on the Android device before sending the dive points to the web
server by simply deleting the inappropriate locations. This might be necessary, for
instance, if one wants to keep the location list clear to see dives in the web service map display (see above).

<div class="paragraph"><p>This brings one to the time synchronisation dialog, shown below. The
critical problem is that the time
synchronisation is not perfect between the dive computer used during a dive,
and the camera used during that same dive. These two devices
often differ by several minutes. If <em>Subsurface</em> can achieve synchronisation,
then the exact times of photographs can be used to position photographs on
the dive profile.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Subsurface</em> achieves this synchronisation in two ways:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Manually</strong>: If the user wrote down the exact camera time at the start of a dive, the
difference in time between the two devices can be determined. Actually, as long as the device
settings for time has not been changed in either device, one could write down the times of
both devices after the dive or even at the end of the day. One can then manually set the time
difference in the <em>Time shift</em> dialog. Towards the top of the dialog is a time setting tool
immediately under the heading <em>Shift times of image(s) by</em>, evident in figure <strong>A</strong> below.
If the camera time is 7 minutes later than that of the dive computer, set the time setting
tool to a value of 00:07.  Select either the <em>earlier</em> or <em>later</em> radio button.
In the above example, the <em>earlier</em> option is appropriate, since the photos need to be shifted
7 minutes earlier (camera is 7 minutes ahead of dive computer). Ignore any "AM" or "PM" suffix
in that tool. Click the <em>OK</em> button and synchronisation is achieved.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/LoadImage3b.jpg" alt="FIGURE: Synchronisation dialog" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>By photograph</strong>: There is a very slick way of achieving synchronisation. If one takes a
photograph of the face of the dive computer showing the time, then <em>Subsurface</em> can obtain
the exact time the photograph was taken, using the metadata that the camera stores within
each photo. In order to do this, use the bottom half of the Time shift_ dialog. If one uses
the bottom part, the top part of the dialog is ignored. Click on
the horizontal bar entitled "<em>Select image of divecomputer showing time</em>. This brings up
a file browser with which one can select the photograph of the dive computer. Select the
photograph using the file browser and click on <em>OK</em>. This photograph of the dive computer
appears in the bottom panel of the <em>Shift times</em> dialog. Now <em>Subsurface</em> knows exactly
when the photograph has been taken. Now set the date-time dialog to the left of the photo
so that this tool reflects the date and time of the dive computer in the photo. When the
date-time tool has been set, <em>Subsurface</em> knows exactly what the time difference between
camera and dive computer is, and synchronisation is achieved. There is a
photograph with the face of the dive computer and with the date-time tool set to the
date-time on image <strong>B</strong> above.

<div class="paragraph"><p>Most underwater photographers store their photos on an external drive. If such a drive can be mapped
(almost always the case) the photos can be directly accessed by <em>Subsurface</em>. This facilitates the interaction
between <em>Subsurface</em> and an external repository of photos. When associating a dive profile with photos from an
external drive, the normal procedure of selection and synchronisation (see text above) is used.
However, after the external drive has been disconnected, <em>Subsurface</em> cannot access these photos any more.
If the display of photos is activated (using the toolbox to the left of the <em>Dive Profile</em>), the
program only shows a small white dot where each photo should be on the dive profile.
In addition the <em>Photos</em> tab only shows the file names of the photos. This is normal behaviour.
If, later, the external drive with the photos is connected again, the photos can be seen in the normal way.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The profile can also include the dive computer reported <strong>ceiling</strong> (more
precisely, the deepest deco stop that the dive computer calculated for each
particular moment in time) as a red overlay on  the dive profile. Ascent ceilings
arise when a direct ascent to the surface increases
the risk of a diver suffering from decompression sickness (DCS) and it is necessary
to either ascend
slower or to perform decompression stop(s) before ascending to the surface. Not
all dive computers record this information and make it available for download;
for example all of the Suunto dive computers fail to make this very useful data
available to divelog software. <em>Subsurface</em> also calculates ceilings independently,
shown as a green overlay on the dive profile.
Because of the differences in algorithms used
and amount of data available (and other factors taken into consideration at the time
of the calculation) it is unlikely that ceilings from dive computers and from <em>Subsurface</em>
are the same, even if the same algorithm and <em>gradient factors</em> (see below) are used.
It is also quite common that <em>Subsurface</em> calculates a ceiling for
non-decompression dives when the dive computer stayed in non-deco mode during
the whole dive (represented by the <span class="green">dark green</span> section in the profile
at the beginning of this section). This is caused by the fact that
<em>Subsurface’s</em>
calculations describe the deco obligation at each moment during a dive,
while dive computers usually take the upcoming ascent into account. During the
ascent some excess nitrogen (and possibly helium) are already breathed off so
even
though the diver technically encountered a ceiling at depth, the dive still does
not require an explicit deco stop. This feature allows dive computers to offer
longer non-stop bottom times.</p></div>

the narcotic gases nitrogen and oxygen as the current trimix dive. A
trimix diver can expect the same narcotic effect as a diver breathing
air diving at a depth equalling the END.</td>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="S_gas_pressure_graph">5.5.1. The Gas Pressure Bar Graph</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>On the left of the <strong>Information Box</strong> is a vertical bar graph indicating the
pressures of the nitrogen (and other inert gases, e.g. helium, if applicable) that the diver
was inhaling <em>at a particular instant during the dive</em>, indicated by the position
of the cursor on the <strong>Dive Profile</strong>. The drawing on the left below indicates the
meaning of the different parts of the Gas Pressure Bar Graph.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/GasPressureBarGraph.jpg" alt="FIGURE:Gas Pressure bar Graph" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The light green area indicates the total gas, with the top margin of the light green
area indicating the total gas pressure inhaled by the diver and measured from the bottom
of the graph to the top of the light green area. This pressure has a <em>relative</em> value in the graph
and does not indicate absolute pressure.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The horizontal black line underneath the light green margin indicates the equilibrium pressure
of the inert gases inhaled by the diver, usually nitrogen. In
the case of trimix, it is the pressures of nitrogen and helium combined. In this example,
the user is diving with EAN32, so the inert gas pressure is 68% of the distance from the
bottom of the graph to the total gas pressure value.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The dark green area at the bottom of the graph represents the pressures of inert gas in each
of the 16 tissue compartments, following the Bühlmann algorithm, the fast tissues being on the
left hand side.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The top black horizontal line indicates the the gradient factor that applies to the depth of
the diver at the particular point on the <strong>Dive Profile</strong>. The appropriate gradient factor is an
interpolation between the FGLow and GFHigh values specified in the Graph tab of the <strong>Preferences
Panel</strong> of <strong>Subsurface</strong>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The bottom margin of the red area in the graph indicates the Bühlman-derived M-value, that is the
pressure value of inert gases at which bubble formation is expected to be severe, resulting
in decompression sickness.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>These five values are indicated on the left in the graph above. The way the Gas Pressure Bar Graph changes
during a dive is indicated on the right hand side of the above figure for a diver using EAN32.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Graph <strong>A</strong> indicates the situation at the start of a dive with diver at the surface. The pressures in all
the tissue compartments are still at the quilibrium pressure because no diving has taken place.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Graph <strong>B</strong> indicates the situation after a descent to 30 meters. Few of the tissue compartments have had
time to respond to the descent, their gas pressures being far below the equilibrium gas pressure.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Graph <strong>C</strong> represents the pressures after 30 minutes at 30 m. The fast compartments have attained
equilibrium (i.e. they have reached the hight of the black line indicating the equilibrium pressure). The
slower compartments (towards the right) have not reached equilibrium and are in the process of slowly
increasing in pressure.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Graph <strong>D</strong> shows the pressures after ascent to a depth of 4.5 meters. Since, during ascent, the total
inhaled gas pressure has decreased strongly from 4 bar to 1.45 bar, the pressures in the different tissue
compartments now exceed that of the total gas pressure and approaches the gradient factor value (i.e.
the top black horizontal line). Further ascent will result in exceeding the gradient
factor value (GFHigh), endangering the diver.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Graph <strong>E</strong> indicates the situation after remaining at 4.5 meters for 10 minutes. The fast compartments
have decreased in pressure. As expected, the pressures in the slow compartments have not changed much.
The pressures in the fast compartments do not approach the GFHigh value any more and the diver is safer
than in the situation indicated in graph <strong>D</strong>.

of the dives is not always consistent. For instance, when non-recent dives are
added to the dive list the numbering does not automatically follow on because
of the dives that are more recent in date/time than the newly-added dive with
an older date/time. Therefore, one may sometimes need to renumber the dives.
This is performed by selecting (from the Main Menu) <em>Log &#8594; Renumber</em>. Users are

</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Four filter criteria may be used to filter the dive list: dive tags, person (buddy / dive master), dive site
and dive suit, each of which is represented by a check list with check boxes. Above
each check list is a second-level filter tool, allowing the listing of only some of
the attributes within that check list. For instance, typing "<em>ca</em>" in the filter
textbox above the tags check list results in the tags check list being reduced
to "<em>cave</em>" and "<em>cavern</em>". Filtering of the check list enables the rapid finding
of search terms for filtering the dive list.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To activate filtering of the dive list, the check box of at least one item in one of
the four check lists needs to be checked. The dive list is then shortened to include
only the dives that pertain to the selection criteria specified in the check lists.
The four check lists work as a filter with <em>AND</em> operators, Subsurface
filters therfore  for <em>cave</em> as a tag AND <em>Joe Smith</em> as a buddy; but the
filters within a category are inclusive - filtering for <em>cave</em> and <em>boat</em>
shows those dives that have either one or both of these tags.</p></div>

<h2 id="S_Cloud_access">8. Keeping a <em>Subsurface</em> dive log in the Cloud</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>For each diver, dive log information is highly important. Not only is it a record
of diving activities for one&#8217;s own pleasure, but it is important information required
for admission to further training courses or (sometimes) even diving sites. The
security of the dive log is therefore critical. In order to have a dive log that is
resistant to failure of a home computer hard drive, loss or theft of equipment, the
Cloud is an obvious solution. This also has the added benefit that one can access one&#8217;s dive
log from anywhere in the world without having to carry it with oneself. For this
reason, facilities such as <em>divelogs.de</em> and <em>Diving Log</em> offer facilities to store
dive log information on the Internet. Although <em>Subsurface</em> does not offer integrated
Cloud storage of dive logs, it is simple to achieve this using several of the
existing facilities on the Internet.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For instance
<a href="http://www.dropbox.com/"><em>Dropbox</em></a>
offers a free application that allows
files on the Dropbox servers to be seen as a local folder on one&#8217;s desktop computer.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/Cloud.jpg" alt="FIGURE: Dropbox folder" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <em>Dropbox</em> program creates a copy of the <em>Dropbox</em> Internet Cloud content on one&#8217;s
desktop computer. When the computer is connected to the Internet, the Internet
content is automatically updated. Therefore both the <em>Open</em> and <em>Save</em> of dive logs are done
using the local copy of the dive log in the local <em>Dropbox</em> folder, so there&#8217;s no need
for a direct internet connection. If the local copy is modified, e.g. by adding a dive,
the remote copy in the <em>Dropbox</em> server in the Cloud will be automatically updated whenever
Internet access is available.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In this way a dive log in
one&#8217;s <em>Dropbox</em> folder can be accessed seamlessly from the Internet and can
be accessed from any place with Internet access. Currently there are no costs
involved for this service. Dropbox (Windows, Mac
and Linux) can be installed by accessing the
<a href="http://www.dropbox.com/install"><em>Install Page on the Dropbox website</em></a>
. Alternatively one can use <em>Dropbox</em> as a mechanism to backup one&#8217;s dive log. To
Store a dive log in the Cloud, select <em>File&#8594;Save as</em> from the <em>Subsurface</em> main menu,
navigate to the <em>Dropbox</em> folder and select the <em>Save</em> button. To access the dive log
in the Cloud, select <em>File&#8594;Open Logbook</em> from the <em>Subsurface</em>
main menu and navigate to the dive log file in the <em>Dropbox</em> folder and select the
<em>Open</em> button.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Several paid services exist on the Internet (e.g. Google, Amazon) where the same
process could be used for the Cloud-based storage of dive logs.</p></div>

</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="S_PrintDivelog">9. Printing a dive log</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Subsurface</em> provides a simple interface to print a whole dive log or only a
few selected dives, including dive profiles and other contextual information.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Before printing, two decisions are required:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Should the whole dive log be printed or only part of it? If only part of the
dive log is required, then the user must select the required dives from the <strong>Dive List</strong> panel.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
What gas partial pressure information is required on the dive profile? Users should select
the appropriate toggle-buttons on the button bar to the left of the Dive Profile panel.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now the print options should be selected to match the user&#8217;s needs. To do this, user should select <em>File&#8594;Print</em> from
the Main menu. The following dialogue appears (see the image on the left [A],
below).</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/PrintDiveLog.jpg" alt="FIGURE: Print dialogue" />

</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Under <em>Print type</em> users need to select one of three options:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Print the complete Dive List: to do this, <em>Table Print</em> should be selected.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Print the selected dives (dive profiles and all other information) at 6
dives per printed page: to do this, users should select <em>6 dives per page</em>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Print the selected dives (dive profiles and all other information) at 2
dives per printed page: to do this, users should select <em>2 dives per page</em>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Print the selected dives (dive profiles and all other information) at 1
dive per printed page: to do this, users should select <em>1 dive per page</em>.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Under <em>Print options</em> users need to select:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Printing only the dives that have been selected from the dive list prior to
activating the print dialogue, achieved by checking the box <em>Print only
selected dives</em>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Printing in colour, achieved by checking the box with <em>Print in colour</em>.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <em>Ordering</em> affects the layout of the page (or part of it) for each dive.
The dive profile could be printed at the top of each dive, with the textual
information underneath, or it could be printed with the textual information at
the top with the dive profile underneath. Users should select the appropriate option in the
print dialogue. See the image below which has a layout with
text below the dive profile.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Users can <em>Preview</em> the printed page by selecting the <em>Preview</em> button on the
dialogue. After preview, changes to the options in the print dialogue can be
made, resulting in a layout that fits personal taste.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Next, select the <em>Print</em> button in the dialogue. This activates the regular print
dialogue used by the user operating system (image [<strong>B</strong>] in the middle, above),
allowing them to choose a printer and to set its properties (image [<strong>C</strong>] on the right,
above).
It is important to set the print resolution of the printer to an appropriate value by
changing
the printer properties. Finally, one can print the dives. Below is a (rather small)

Gradient Factors:* Here users can set the <em>gradient factors</em> used while diving. GF_Low is
the gradient factor at depth and GF_High is used just below the surface.
At intermediate depths gradient factors between GF_Low and GF_High are used.
Gradient factors add conservatism to the nitrogen exposure during a dive, in a
similar way that many dive computers have a conservatism setting. The lower
the value of a gradient factor, the more conservative the calculations are with
respect to nitrogen loading and the deeper the ascent ceilings are. Gradient
factors of 20/60 are considered conservative and values of 60/90 are considered
harsh. Checking <strong>GFLow at max depth</strong> box causes GF_Low to be used at the
deepest depth of a dive. If this box is not checked, GF_Low is applied at
all depths deeper than the first deco stop. For more information see:

<h3 id="_initiating_dive_planning">11.2. Initiating dive planning</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The dive planner comprises two parts: <strong>constructing a dive plan</strong> and <strong>evaluating</strong>
that dive plan. To perform dive planning, perform these steps:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Clear the existing dive log by creating a new planning log. This is achieved by selecting
<em>File &#8594; New logbook</em> from the main menu. This way, dive plans are kept separate
from the existing dive log of completed dives.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In the top left-hand area of the screen, ensure that the constant dive parameters are
appropriate. These are: Start date and time of the dive, Atmospheric Pressure and Altitude
above sea level of the dive site. The atmospheric pressure can also be entered as an altitude
in metres, assuming an atmospheric pressure of 1.013 bar.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In the table labelled <em>Available Gases</em>, add the information of the cylinders to be used
as well as the gas composition within that cylinder. This is done in a similar way as for
<a href="#S_CylinderData">providing cylinder data for dive logs</a>. Choose the cylinder type by
double clicking the cylinder type and using the dropdown list, then specify the work
pressure of this cylinder. By leaving the oxygen concentration (O2%) filed empty,
the dive gas is assumed to be air. Otherwise enter the oxygen and/or helium
concentration in the boxes provided in this dialogue. Add additional cylinders by using the
"+" icon to the top righthand of the dialogue.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The dialogue indicating <em>Dive Planner Points</em> is usually not used at this stage of the dive
planning.

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_managing_nitrogen_oxygen_and_gas_consumption">11.3. Managing nitrogen, oxygen and gas consumption</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The planning is performed in three stages:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>a) Nitrogen management</strong>: This is performed by specifying the rates for descent and ascent,
as well as the gradient factors (GFLow and GFHigh) under the headings <em>Rates</em> and <em>Planning</em>
to the bottom left of the planning screen. Initially, the GFHigh and GFLow values in the <em>Preferences</em>
panel of <em>Subsurface</em> is used. If these are changed within the planner (see <em>Gas Options</em> within
the planner), the new values are
used without changing the original specifications in the <em>Preferences</em>. Gradient Factor settings strongly affect the calculated ceilings and their depths.
A very low GFLow value brings about decompression stops early on during the dive.

An excellent non-technical review.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The ascent rate is critical for nitrogen off-gassing at the end of the dive and is specified
for several depth ranges, utilising the average (or mean) depth as a yardstick. The mean depth
of the dive plan is indicated on the dive profile in the green panel of the dive planner. Ascent rates
at deeper levels are often in the range of 8-12 m/min, while ascent rates near the surface are
often in the range of 4-9 m/min. The descent rate is also specified. If the option <em>Drop to first depth</em>
is activated, then the descent phase of the planned dive will be at the maximal descent rate specified
in the <em>Rates</em> section of the dive setup.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>b) Oxygen management</strong>: In the <strong>Gas Options</strong> part of the dive specification, the maximum partial
pressure for oxygen needs to be specified for the
bottom part of the dive (<em>bottom po2</em>) as well as for the decompression part of the dive (<em>deco po2</em>).
The most commonly
used values are 1.4 bar for the bottom part of the dive and 1.6 bar for any decompression
stages. Normally, a partial pressure of 1.6 bar is not exceeded. PO2 settings and the depth at which switching to a gas takes place can also be edited in the
<em>Available Gases</em> dialog. Normally the planner decides on switching to a new gas when, during
ascent, the partial pressure of the new gas has decreased to 1.6 bar.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>c) Gas management</strong>: One needs keep within the limits of the amount of gas contained in the dive
cylinder(s), allowing for an appropriate margin for safe return to the surface, possibly
sharing with a buddy. Under the <em>Gas Options</em> heading, specify the best (but conservative) estimate
of your surface-equivalent air consumption (SAC, also termed RMV) in
litres/min (for the time being, only SI units are supported).  Specify the SAC during the
bottom part of the dive (<em>bottom SAC</em>) as well as during the decompression or safety stops of the
dive (<em>deco SAC</em>). Values of 20-30 l/min are common. For good gas management, a thumbsuck guess
is not sufficient and one needs to
monitor one&#8217;s gas consumption on a regular basis, dependent on different dive conditions and/or equipment.
The planner will calculate the total volume of gas used during the dive and will issue a warning
if one exceeds the total amount of gas available. Good practice demands that one does not dive to
the limit of the gas supply but that an appropriate reserve is kept for unforeseen circumstances.
For technical diving, this reserve can be up to 66% of the total available gas.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Now (at last) one can start the detailed time-depth planning of the dive. <em>Subsurface</em> offers a unique
graphical interface for performing this part of the planning. The mechanics of doing this is
similar to hand-entering a dive profile in the dive log part of <em>Subsurface</em>. Upon activating the
planner, a default dive of depth 15 m for 40 min is offered in the green design surface to the top
right hand of the screen. The white dots (waypoints) on the
profile can be dragged with a mouse. Create more waypoints by double-clicking on the profile
line and ensuring that the profile reflects the intended dive. Drag the waypoints to represent
the depth and duration of the dive.
If any of the management limits (for nitrogen, oxygen or gas) is exceeded, the surface
above the dive profile changes from BLUE to RED.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Each waypoint on the dive profile creates a <em>Dive Planner Point</em> in the table on the
left of the dive planner panel. Ensure that the <em>Used Gas</em> value in each row
of that table corresponds to one of the gas mixtures specified in the table with
<em>Available Gases</em> immediately above the Dive Planner Points. Add new waypoints
until the main features of the dive have been completed, e.g. the
bottom time segment and deep stops (if these are implemented). Leave the remaining
waypoints on the ascent to <em>Subsurface</em>. In most cases <em>Subsurface</em>
computes additional way points in order to fulfil decompression requirements for that
dive.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A waypoint can be moved by selecting that waypoint and by using the arrow keys.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The waypoints listed in the <em>Dive Planner Points</em> dialogue can be edited by hand in
order to obtain a precise presentation of the dive plan. In fact, one can create the
whole dive profile by editing the <em>Dive Planner Points</em> dialog.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Indicate any changes in gas cylinder used by indicating gas changes as explained
in the section <a href="#S_CreateProfile">hand-creating a dive profile</a>. These changes should
reflect the cylinders and gas compositions defined in the table with <em>Available Gases</em>.
If two or more gases are used, automatic gas switches will be suggested during the ascent to
the surface. However, these changes can be deleted by right-clicking the gas change and by
manually creating a gas change by right-clicking on the appropriate waypoint.

options under the <em>Dive Notes</em> section of the dive planner, immediately to the left
of the <em>Dive Plan Details</em>. If a <em>Verbatim diveplan</em>
is requested, a detailed sentence-level explanation of the dive plan is given. If any
of the management specifications have been exceeded during the planning, a warning
message is printed underneath the dive plan information.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If the option <em>Display segment duration</em> is checked, then the duration of each depth
level is indicated in the <em>Dive Plan Details</em>. This duration INCLUDES the transition
time to get to that level. However, if the <em>Display transition in deco</em> option is checked,
the transitions are shown separately from the segment durations at a particular level.</p></div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="S_Replan">11.5. Modifying an existing dive plan</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Normally, when a dive plan has been saved, it is accessible from the <strong>Dive List</strong>, like any
other dive log. Within the <strong>Dive List</strong> there is not a way to change a saved dive plan.
To perform changes to a dive plan, select it on the <strong>Dive List</strong>. Then, in the main menu,
select <em>Log &#8594; Re-plan dive</em>. This will open the selected dive plan within the dive planner,
allowing changes to be made and saved as usual.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_planning_for_repetitive_dives">11.6. Planning for repetitive dives</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Repetitive dives can easily be planned if the dates and start times of the
repetitive dive set
is specified appropriately in the top left-hand <em>Start Time</em> field. <em>Subsurface</em>
calculates the gas loading figures correctly and the effect of the first dive is
evaluated on later dives.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If one has just completed a long/deep dive and is planning
another dive, then highlight, in the <strong>Dive List</strong>, the dive that has just been completed
and then activate the planner. Depending on the start time of the planned dive,
the planner takes into account the gas loading incurred during the completed dive
and allows planning within these limitations.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If only a few standard configurations are used (e.g. in GUE), then a template dive can
be created conforming to one of the configurations. If one now wishes to plan a dive using
this configuration, just highlight the template dive in the <strong>Dive List</strong> and activate the
planner: the planner takes into account the configuration in the highlighted dive.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_printing_the_dive_plan">11.7. Printing the dive plan</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Selecting the <em>Print</em> button in the planner allows printing of the  <em>Dive Plan Details</em>
for wet notes. Alternatively one can cut and paste the <em>Dive Plan Details</em> for
inclusion in a text file or word processing document.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Dive plans have many characteristics in common with dive logs (dive profile, dive notes, etc).
After a dive plan has been saved, the dive details and gas calculations are saved in
the <strong>Dive Notes</strong> tab. While a dive plan is being designed, it can be printed using
the <em>Print</em> button in the dive planner. This prints the dive details and gas calculations
in the <em>Dive Plan Details</em> panel of the dive planner. However, after the plan has been saved, it is
represented in a way very similar to a dive log and the gas calculations cannot be
accessed in the same way as during the planning process. The only way to print the
dive plan is to use the <em>File&#8594;Print</em> facility on the main menu in the same way as for dive logs.</p></div>

<p>

</p>
</li>

<em>Dive Log &#8594; Upload Log</em> and wait for the <em>Wait PC</em> message.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Pair the <em>Subsurface</em> computer with the dive computer.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">On Windows:</div><p>Bluetooth is most likely already enabled. For pairing with the dive computer choose
<em>Control Panel&#8594;Bluetooth Devices&#8594;Add Wireless Device</em>.
This should bring up a dialog showing your dive computer (in Bluetooth mode) and
allowing pairing. Right click on it and choose <em>Properties&#8594;COM
Ports</em> to identify the port used for your dive computer. If there are several
ports listed, use the one saying "Outgoing" instead of "Incoming".</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For downloading to <em>Subsurface</em>, the <em>Subsurface</em> drop-down list should contain
this COM port already. If not, enter it manually.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note: If there are issues afterwards when downloading from the dive computer using
other software, remove the existing pairing with the dive computer.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">On MacOS:</div><p>Click on the Bluetooth symbol in the menu bar and select <em>Set up
Bluetooth Device&#8230;</em>. The dive computer should then show up in the list of devices. Select it and go
through the pairing process. This step should only be needed once for
initial setup.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Once the pairing is completed the correct device is shown in the
<em>Device or Mount Point</em> drop-down in the <em>Subsurface</em> <strong>Import</strong> dialog.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">On Linux</div><p>Ensure Bluetooth is enabled on the <em>Subsurface</em> computer.
On most common distributions this should be true out of the box and
pairing should be straight forward. For instance, Gnome3 shows a
Bluetooth icon in the upper right corner of the desktop where one selects <em>Set
up New Device</em>. This should show a dialog where one can select the
dive computer (which already should be in Bluetooth mode) and pair it.
If a PIN is required, try manually setting <em>0000</em>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the rare cases where the above is not true, then
depending on your system, try <code>initd</code> or <code>systemd</code>. This might be different
and also involve loading modules specific to your hardware. In case your system
is running <code>systemd</code>, manually run <code>systemctl start bluetooth.service</code> to
enable it, in case of <code>initd</code>, run something like <code>rc.config start bluetoothd</code> or
<code>/etc/init.d/bluetooth start</code>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>One may also use a manual approach by using such commands:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<code>hciconfig</code> shows the Bluetooth devices available on your
computer (not dive computer), most likely one will see a hci0, if not
try <code>hcitool -a</code> to see inactive devices and  run <code>sudo
hciconfig hci0 up</code> to bring them up.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>hcitool scanning</code> gets a list of bluetooth enabled
client devices, look for the dive computer and remember the MAC
address are shown there

</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>bluez-simple-agent hci0 10:00:E8:C4:BE:C4</code>  pairs
the dive computer with the bluetooth stack of the <em>Subsurface</em> computer, copy/paste
the MAC address from the output of <em>hcitool scanning</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Unfortunately on Linux binding to a communication device has to be done
manually by running:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<code>rfcomm bind /dev/rfcomm0 10:00:E8:C4:BE:C4</code> binds the dive
computer to a communication device in the desktop computer, in case rfcomm is
already taken use rfcomm1 or up. IMPORTANT: Copy/paste the MAC address
from the output of <code>hcitool scanning</code>, the MAC address shown above will not
work.

Things are very similar to a normal USB-connected dive computer
(the Uemis is one of those that recharge when connected to the USB port).
The main difference is that one does not enter a
device name, but instead the location where the UEMISSDA file system is
mounted once connected to the dive computer. On Windows this is a drive letter (
often <em>E:</em> or <em>F:</em>), on a Mac this is
<em>/Volumes/UEMISSDA</em> and on Linux systems this differs depending on the
distribution. On Fedora it usually is
<em>/var/run/media/&lt;your_username&gt;/UEMISSDA</em>. In all cases <em>Subsurface</em>

<div class="paragraph"><p>After selecting the above device name, download the

download implementation (this is a Uemis firmware limitation, not a
<em>Subsurface</em> issue) is that one cannot download more than about 40-50
dives without running out of memory on the SDA. This will usually only
happen the very first time one downloads dives from the Uemis Zurich.
Normally when downloading at the end of a day or even after a dive
trip, the capacity is sufficient. If <em>Subsurface</em> displays an error
that the dive computer ran out of space the solution is straight
forward.  Disconnect the SDA, turn it off and on again, and reconnect
it. You can now retry (or start a new download session) and the
download will continue where it stopped previously. One
may have to do this more than once, depending on how many dives are
stored on the dive computer.</p></div>

<h3 id="_subsurface_appears_to_miscalculate_gas_consumption_and_sac">16.1. Subsurface appears to miscalculate gas consumption and SAC</h3>
<div class="paragraph" id="SAC_CALCULATION"><p><em>Question</em>: I dived with a 12.2 l tank, starting with 220 bar and ending with 100 bar, and I calculate a different SAC compared what <em>Subsurface</em> calculates. Is <em>Subsurface</em>
miscalculating?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Answer</em>: Not really. What happens is that <em>Subsurface</em> actually calculates gas
consumption differently - and better - than you expect.
In particular, it takes the incompressibility of the gas into account.
Traditionally, Gas consumption and SAC should be:
<code>consumption = tank size x (start pressure - end pressure)</code></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>and that&#8217;s true for an ideal gas, and it&#8217;s what you get taught in dive theory.
But an "ideal gas" doesn&#8217;t actually exist, and real gases actually don&#8217;t compress
linearly with pressure. Also, you are missing the fact that one atmosphere of
pressure isn&#8217;t actually one bar.
So the <strong>real</strong> calculation is:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><code>consumption = (amount_of_air_at_beginning - amount_of_air_at_end)</code></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>where the amount of air is <strong>not</strong> just "tank size times pressure in bar".
It&#8217;s a combination of: "take compressibility into account" (which is a fairly
small issue under 220 bar - you&#8217;ll see more differences when you do high-pressure
tanks with 300bar) and "convert bar to atm" (which is the majority of your discrepancy).
Remember: one ATM is ~1.013 bar, so without the compressibility, your gas use is:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><code>12.2*((220-100)/1.013)</code></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>which is about 1445, not 1464. So there was 19 l too much in your simple
calculation that ignored the difference between 1 bar and one ATM.
The compressibility does show up above 200 bar, and takes that 1445 down
about eight litres more, so you really did use only about 1437 l of air at surface pressure.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So be happy: your SAC really is better than your calculations indicated.
Or be sad: your cylinder contains less air than you thought it did.
And as mentioned, the "contains less air than you thought it did" really
starts becoming much more noticeable at high pressure. A 400 bar really does not
contain twice as much air as a 200 bar one. At lower pressures, air acts pretty much like an ideal gas.</p></div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_some_dive_profiles_have_time_discrepancies_with_the_recorded_samples_from_my_dive_computer_8230">16.2. Some dive profiles have time discrepancies with the recorded samples from my dive computer&#8230;</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Subsurface</em> ends up ignoring surface time for many things (average depth, divetime, SAC, etc).
<em>Question</em>:  Why do dive durations in my dive computer differ from that given by <em>Subsurface</em>?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Answer</em>: For example, if you end up doing a weight check (deep enough to trigger the "dive started")
but then come back up and wait five minutes for your buddies, your dive computer may say
that your dive is 50 minutes long - because you have fifty minutes worth of samples - but
subsurface will say it&#8217;s 45 minutes - because you were actually diving for 45 minutes.
It&#8217;s even more noticeable if you do things like divemastering the initial OW dives, when
you may stay in the water for a long time, but spend most of it at the surface. And then
 you don&#8217;t want that to count as some kind of long dive”.</p></div>
