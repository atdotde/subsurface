<div class="paragraph"><p><span class="blue"><em>Version 4.0.1,  January 2014</em></span></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Welcome as a user of <em>Subsurface</em>, an advanced dive logging programme with
extensive infrastructure to describe, organise, interpret and print scuba
and free dives.
<em>Subsurface</em> binaries are available for Windows PCs (Win XP or later), Intel
based Macs (OS/X) and many Linux distributions. <em>Subsurface</em> can be built for
many more hardware platforms and software environments where Qt and
libdivecomputer are available.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The scope of this document is the use of the <em>Subsurface</em> program. To install
the software, consult the <em>Downloads</em> page on the
<a href="http://subsurface.hohndel.org/"><em>Subsurface</em> web site</a>.
Please discuss issues with this program by sending an email to
<a href="mailto:subsurface@hohndel.org">our mailing list</a> and report bugs at
<a href="http://trac.hohndel.org">our bugtracker</a>.  For instructions on how to build the
software and (if needed) its dependencies please consult the INSTALL file
included with the source code.</p></div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="S_StartUsing">1. Start Using the Program</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <em>Subsurface</em> window is usually divided into four panels and has a <strong>Main
Menu</strong> (File Import Log View Filter Help) at the top of the window (for Windows
and Linux) or the top of the screen (for Mac and Ubuntu Unity). The four panels are:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>1) The <strong>Dive List</strong> to the bottom left containing a list of all the dives in the
user&#8217;s
dive log. A dive can be selected and highlighted on the dive list by clicking on
it. In most situations the cursor up/down keys can be used to switch
between dives.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>2) The <strong>Dive Map</strong> to the bottom right, showing the user&#8217;s dive sites on a world
map
and centred on the site of the last selected dive.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>3) The <strong>Dive Info</strong> to the top left, giving more detailed information on the
selected dive, including some statistics for the selected dive or for all
highlighted dive(s).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>4) The <strong>Dive Profile</strong> to the top right, showing a graphical dive profile of the
highlighted dive in the dive list.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The dividers can be dragged between panels in order to change the size of any of
the panels. <em>Subsurface</em> remembers the position of the dividers, so the next
time <em>Subsurface</em> starts it uses the positions of the dividers when the program
was executed previously.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If one dive is selected, the dive location, detailed information and profile of
the <em>selected dive</em> are shown in the respective panels. On the other hand, if
one highlights more than one dive the last highlighted dive is the <em>selected
dive</em>, but summary data of all <em>highlighted dives</em> is shown in the <strong>Stats</strong> tab
of the <strong>Dive Info</strong> panel (maximum, minimum and average depths, durations, water
temperatures and SAC; total time and number of dives selected).</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" id="S_ViewPanels" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/main_window.jpg" alt="The Main Window" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The user can determine which of the four panels are displayed by selecting the
<strong>View</strong> option on the main menu. This option gives the user several choices of
display:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>All</strong>: show all four of the panels as in the screenshot above.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Divelist</strong>: Show only the Dive List.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Profile</strong>: Show only the Dive Profile of the selected dive.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Info</strong>: Show only the Dive Notes about the last selected dive and statistics for
all highlighted dives.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Globe</strong>: Show only the world map, centred on the last selected dive.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Like many other functions that can be accessed via the Main Menu, these options
can be triggered using keyboard shortcuts as well. The shortcuts for a
particular system
are shown with an underline in the menu entries. Since different Operating
Systems and the user chosen language may cause <em>Subsurface</em> to use different
shortcut keys they will not be listed here in the user manual.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When the program is started for the first time, it shows no information at all.
This is because the program doesn&#8217;t have any dive information available. In the
following sections, the procedures to create a new logbook will be described.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="S_NewLogbook">2. Creating a new logbook</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Select <em>File &#8594; New Logbook</em> from the main menu. All existing dive data are
cleared so that new information can be added. If there is unsaved data in an
open logbook, <em>Subsurface</em> the user will be asked if the open logbook will be
saved before a new logbook is created.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="S_GetInformation">3. How to obtain dive information to store in the user&#8217;s logbook</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are several ways in which dive information can be added to a logbook:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
Enter dive information by hand. This is typically useful if the diver did not
use a dive computer and dives were recorded in a written logbook.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Import dive information directly from a dive computer if it is supported by
<em>Subsurface</em>. The latest list of dive computers supported by <em>Subsurface</em> can

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="S_EnterData">3.1. Entering dive information by hand</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is usually the approach for dives without a dive computer. The basic record
of information within <em>Subsurface</em> is a dive. The most important information
in a simple dive logbook usually includes dive type, date, time, duration,
depth, the names of your dive buddy and of the dive master or dive guide, and
some remarks about the dive. <em>Subsurface</em> can store much more information
than this for each dive. In order to add a dive to a dive log, select <em>Log
&#8594; Add Dive</em> from the Main Menu. The program then shows three panels to enter
information for a dive: two tabs in the <strong>Info</strong> panel (<strong>Dive Notes</strong> and
<strong>Equipment</strong>), as well as the <strong>profile</strong> panel that displays a graphical profile
of each dive. These panels are respectively marked <span class="red">A</span>, <span class="red">B</span> and
<span class="red">C</span>
in the figure below. Each of these tabs will now be explained for data entry.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_dive_notes">3.1.1. Dive Notes</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This panel contains the date, time and place information for a particular dive,
environmental conditions, co-divers and buddies, as well as some descriptive
information. The message in a blue box at the top of the panel indicates that
the dive is being edited. If one clicks on the <strong>Dive Notes</strong> tab, the following
fields are visible:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/AddDive2.jpg" alt="FIGURE: The Dive Notes tab" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>Starttime</strong> field reflects the date and the time of the dive. By clicking
the down-arrow on the right of that field a calendar will be displayed from
which
one can choose the correct date. The time values (hour and minutes) can also be
edited directly by clicking on each of them in the text box and by overtyping the
information displayed.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Air and water temperatures</strong>: the air and water temperatures during the
dive can be typed directly on the fields to the right of the Starttime.
Temperature units are not needed, as they will be automatically supplied by
<em>Subsurface</em>. Only the numerical value must be
typed by the user (The units selected in the <em>Preferences</em>
will determine whether metric or imperial units are used).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Location</strong>: Here the name of the dive site can be entered, e.g. "Tihany, Lake
Balaton,
Hungary". Auto completion of location names will make this easier if one
frequently dives at the same sites.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Coordinates</strong>: The geographic coordinates of the dive site should be entered
here. These can come from three sources:</p></div>
<div class="olist loweralpha"><ol class="loweralpha">
<li>
<p>
One can find the coordinates on the world map in the bottom right hand
part
of the Subsurface window. The map displays a green bar indicating "No location
data - Move the map double-click to set the location". Upon a double-click
at the appropriate place, the green bar disappears and the coordinates are
stored.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The coordinates can be obtained from the <em>Subsurface</em> Companion app if the
user has an Android device with GPS and if the coordinates of the dive site
were stored using that device.
<a href="#S_Companion">Click here for more information</a>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The coordinates can be entered by hand if they are known, using one of
four formats with latitude followed by longitude:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>ISO 6709 Annex D format e.g. 30°13'28.9"N 30°49'1.5"E
Degrees and decimal minutes, e.g. N30° 13.49760' , E30° 49.30788'
Degrees minutes seconds, e.g. N30° 13' 29.8" , E30° 49' 1.5"
Decimal degrees, e.g. 30.22496 , 30.821798</code></pre>
</div></div>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Southern hemisphere latitudes are given with a <strong>S</strong>, e.g. S30°, or with a
negative value, e.g. -30.22496. Similarly western longitudes are given with a
<strong>W</strong>, e.g. W07°, or with a negative value, e.g. -7.34323.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Please note that GPS coordinates of a dive site a linked to the Location
name - so adding coordinates to dives that don&#8217;t have a location set will
caused unexpected behavior (as Subsurface will think that all of these
dives have the same location and try to keep their GPS coordinates the
same.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Divemaster</strong>: The name of the dive master or dive guide for this dive can be
entered here.
Again, this field offers auto completion based on the list of dive masters in
the current logbook.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Buddy</strong>: In this field one can enter the name(s) of the buddy / buddies
(separated by commas) who accompanied the user on the dive. Auto completion
based on the list of buddies in the current logbook is offered.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Suit</strong>: The type of diving suit that was used for the dive can be entered here.
Just as with the
other items, auto completion of the suit description is available.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Rating</strong>: In this field, users can provide a subjective overall rating of the
dive on a 5-point scale by clicking the appropriate star on the rating scale.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Visibility</strong>: As with the previous item, users can provide a rating of
visibility during the dive on a 5-point scale by clicking the appropriate star.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Tags</strong>: Tags that describe the type of dive performed may
be entered here (separated by commas). Examples of common tags are boat, drift,
training, cave etc. <em>Subsurface</em> has many built-in tags. Auto completion is once again offered.
For instance, if, for instance, <code>cav</code> was typed, then the tags <strong>cave</strong> and <strong>cavern</strong> are
shown for the user to choose from.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Notes</strong>: Any additional information can be typed here.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Cancel</strong> buttons are used to save all the information for tabs in
the info panel and in the dive profile panel, so there&#8217;s no need to use them
until ALL other information has been added. Here is an example of a completed
Dive Notes panel:</p></div>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_equipment">3.1.2. Equipment</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Equipment tab allows the user to enter information about the type of
cylinder and gas used, as well as the weights used for a dive. The message in a
blue
box at the top of the panel:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/BlueEditBar.jpg" alt="Blue edit bar" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>indicates that the dive is being edited. This is a highly interactive part of
<em>Subsurface</em> and the information on
cylinders and gases (entered here) affects the behaviour of the dive profile
(top right-hand panel).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Cylinders</strong>: The cylinder information is entered through a dialogue that looks
like this:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/CylinderDataEntry1.jpg" alt="FIGURE:Initial cylinder dialogue" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The + button at the top right allows the user to add more cylinders for this
dive.
The dark dustbin icon on the left allows one to delete information for a
particular cylinder.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The user starts by selecting a cylinder type on the left-hand side of the
table.  To select a cylinder, the user must click in the <strong>cylinder type</strong> box.
This brings up a list button that can be used to display a dropdown list of
cylinders:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/CylinderDataEntry2.jpg" alt="FIGURE:The cylinder drop-down list button" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This drop-down list can then be used to select the cylinder type that was used
for this dive. The
<strong>Size</strong> of the cylinder as well as its working pressure (<strong>WorkPress</strong>) will
automatically be shown in the dialogue.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Next, the user must indicate the starting pressure and the ending pressure of
the
gas used during the dive. The unit of pressure (metric/imperial) corresponds
to the setting in the preferences.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Finally, the user should type in the gas mixture used. If air
was used, a value of 21% can be entered on this field,  or the field might be
left blank. If nitrox or trimix were used, their percentages of oxygen and/or
helium must be specified.
Any inappropriate fields should be left empty. After typing the information for
the cylinder, press <em>ENTER</em> on the keyboard or click
outside the cell that contains the cursor. Information for any additional
cylinders can be added by using the + button at the top right hand. Following
is an example of a complete description for a
dive made using two cylinders (air and EAN50):</p></div>

<div class="content">
<img src="images/CylinderDataEntry3.jpg" alt="FIGURE: a completed cylinder dive information table" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Weights</strong>: Information about the weight system used during a dive can be entered
using a dialogue very similar to that of the cylinder information. If the user
clicks the + button on the top right of the weights dialogue, the table looks
like this:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/WeightsDataEntry1.jpg" alt="FIGURE: The Weights dialogue" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If one then clicks on the <strong>Type</strong> field, a drop-down list becomes accessible
through a down-arrow:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/WeightsDataEntry2.jpg" alt="FIGURE: Weights type drop-down list button" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This drop-down list can then be used to select the type of weight system. In
the <strong>Weight</strong>
field, the weight used during the dive must be typed. After typing the
information
for the weight system the user must either press <em>ENTER</em> on the keyboard or
click outside the
cell that contains the cursor. It is possible to enter
information for more than one weight system by adding an additional system using
the + button on the top right hand. Weight systems can be deleted using the
dustbin icon on the left hand. Here is an example of information for a dive
with two types of weights: integrated and a weight belt:</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>There&#8217;s NO need to click the <em>Save</em> button before the dive
profile has beeb completed.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_creating_a_dive_profile">3.1.3. Creating a Dive Profile</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>Dive Profile</strong> (a graphical representation of the depth of the dive as a
function of time) is indicated in the panel on the top right hand of the
<em>Subsurface</em> window. When a dive is manually added to a logbook, <em>Subsurface</em>
presents a default dive profile that needs to be modified to best represent the
dive being described:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/DiveProfile1.jpg" alt="FIGURE: Initial dive profile" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Modifying the dive profile</em>: When the cursor is moved around the dive profile,
its position is indicated by two red lines as shown below. The depth and time
that the cursor represents are indicated, respectively on the left hand and
bottom axes. The units (metric/imperial) on the axes are determined by the
<strong>preference</strong> settings. The dive profile itself comprises several
line segments demarcated by waypoints (white dots on the profile, as shown
above). The default dive depth is 15 m.
If the dive depth was 21 m then the user needs to drag the appropriate waypoints
downwards to represent 21 m. To add a waypoint, double-click on
any line segment.
To remove a waypoint, right-click on it and choose "Remove this point" from the
context menu. The user will also need to drag the waypoints to represent an
accurate
time duration for the dive. Below is a dive profile that represents a dive
to 21 m for 31 min, followed by a 3 minute safety stop at 5 m.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/DiveProfile2.jpg" alt="FIGURE: Edited dive profile" />

</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Specifying the gas composition:</em> The gas composition used is clearly indicated
along the line segments of the dive profile. This defaults to the first gas
mixture specified in the <strong>Equipment</strong> tab, which was air in the case of the
profile illustrated above. The gas mixtures of segments of the dive profile can
be edited. This is done by clicking on the particular
waypoint and selecting the appropriate gas from the context menu. Changing
the gas for a waypoint affects the gas shown in the segment <em>to the left</em> of
that
waypoint. Note that only the gases defined in the <strong>Equipment</strong> tab appear in the
context menu:</p></div>

therefore
recommend that the user checks if the dive computer is charged when
connected to the USB port of a PC. For example, several Suunto and Mares dive

</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To import dive information from a dive computer to a computer with
<em>Subsurface</em>,
it is necessary that the two pieces of equipment communicate with one another.
This
involves setting up the communications port (or mount point) of the computer
with <em>Subsurface</em> that communicates with the dive computer. In order to set up
this communication, one needs to find the appropriate information to
instruct
<em>Subsurface</em> where and how to import the dive information. <strong>Appendix A</strong> provides
the technical information to help the user achieving this for different
operating
systems and <strong>Appendix B</strong> has dive computer specific information.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>After this, the dive computer can be hooked up to the user&#8217;s PC, which can be
achieved by following these steps:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The interface cable should be connected to a free USB port (or the Infrared
        or Bluetooth connection set up as described later in this manual)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The dive computer should be placed into PC Communication mode.
        (Users should refer to the manual of their specific dive computer)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
In <em>Subsurface</em>, from the Main Menu, the user must select <em>Import &#8594; Import
From Dive Computer</em>.
Dialogue <strong>A</strong> in the figure below appears:
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ImportFromDC1.jpg" alt="FIGURE: Download dialogue 1" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Dive computers tend to keep a certain number of dives in their memory, even
though these dives have already been imported to <em>Subsurface</em>. For that reason
<em>Subsurface</em> only imports dives that have not been uploaded before. This makes
the download process faster on most dive computers and also saves battery power
of the dive computer (at least for those not charging while connected via USB).
If, for some reason, the user wishes to import ALL dives from the dive computer,
even though some may already be in the logbook, then the the check box labeled
<em>Force download of all dives</em> can be ticked.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The dialogue has two drop-down lists, <strong>Vendor</strong> and <strong>Dive Computer</strong>. On the
<strong>vendor</strong> drop-down list the user must select the make of the computer, e.g.
Suunto, Oceanic,
Uwatec, Mares. On the <strong>Dive Computer</strong> drop-down list, the model name of
the dive computer must be selected, e.g. D4 (Suunto), Veo200 (Oceanic), or Puck
(Mares).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <strong>Device or Mount Point</strong> drop-down list contains the USB or Bluetooth port
name that <em>Subsurface</em> needs in order to communicate with the dive computer.
The appropriate port name must be selected. Consult <strong>Appendix A</strong>
and <strong>Appendix B</strong> for
technical details on how to find the appropriate port information for a
particular dive
computer and, in some cases, how to do the correct settings to the operating
system of the computer on which <em>Subsurface</em> is running.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If all the dives on the dive computer need to be downloaded, check the
   checkbox <em>Force download of all dives</em>. Normally, <em>Subsurface</em> only downloads
   dives after the date-time of the last dive in the <strong>Dive List</strong> panel. If one
   or more of your dives in <em>Subsurface</em> have been accidentally deleted or if there
   are older dives that still need to be downloaded from the dive computer, this
   checkbox needs to be activated. Some dive computers (e.g. Mares Puck) do not provide
   a contents list to <em>Subsurface</em> before the download in order to select only new dives.
   Consequently, for these dive computers, all dives are downloaded
   irrespective of the status of this check box.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If the checkbox <em>Always prefer downloaded dives</em>
   has been checked and, during download, dives with identical date-times exist on
   the dive computer and on the <em>Subsurface</em>
   <strong>Dive List</strong> panel, the record in the <em>Subsurface</em> divelog will be overwritten
   by the record from the dive computer
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Do <strong>not</strong> check the checkboxes labeled <em>Save libdivecomputer logfile</em> and
    <em>Save libdivecomputer dumpfile</em>. These are only used as diagnostic tools
    when problems with downloads are experienced (see below).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <em>OK</em> button must then be clicked. Dialogue <strong>B</strong> in the figure above
appears.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
With communication established, one can see how the data are
retrieved from the dive computer.
Depending on the make of the dive computer and/or number of recorded dives, this
could take some time. The user should be patient. The <em>Download</em> dialogue
shows a
progress bar at the bottom of the dialogue (for some dive computers the
progress information could be inaccurate as we cannot determine how much
downloadable data there is until all data have been downloaded). When the
download of the dive information is complete, all the imported dives appear
in the Dive List, sorted by date and time. Disconnect and
switch off the dive
computer to conserve its battery power.
If a particular dive is selected, the Dive Profile panel shows an informative
graph of dive depth against time for that particular dive.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If there is a problem in communicating with the dive computer, an error
message will be shown, similar to this text: "Unable to open /dev/ttyUSB0 Mares

<div class="paragraph" id="S_ImportingAlienDiveLogs"><p>If a user has been diving for some time, it&#8217;s possible that several dives were
logged using other dive log software. All this information needs not
be typed by hand into <em>Subsurface</em>, because these divelogs can probably be
imported onto <em>Subsurface</em>. <em>Subsurface</em> will import divelogs from a range of
other
dive log software. While some software is supported natively, for others the
user will have to
export the logbook(s) to an intermediate format so that they can then be imported
by <em>Subsurface</em>.
Currently, <em>Subsurface</em> supports importing CSV log files from several sources.
APD LogViewer, XP5 and Sensus files are
preconfigured, but because the import is flexible, users can configure their own
imports.
Manually kept log files (e.g. in spreadsheet) can also be imported by
configuring the CSV import.
<em>Subsurface</em> can also import UDDF and UDCF files that are used by some divelog
software and some divecomputers, like the Heinrichs &amp; Weikamp DR5. Finally,
for some divelog software like Mares Dive Organiser it is currently suggested to
import the logbooks first into a webservice like <em>divelogs.de</em> and then import
them from there with
<em>Subsurface</em>, as divelogs.de supports a few additional logbook formats that
<em>Subsurface</em> currently cannot parse.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When importing dives, <em>Subsurface</em> tries to detect multiple records for
the same dive and merges the information as best as it can. If
there are no time zone issues (or other reasons that would cause the
beginning time of the dives to be significantly different) <em>Subsurface</em>
will not create duplicate entries.</p></div>

closed circuit rebreather (CCR) systems export dive information in CSV format
that normally contains information about a single dive only. These
files can easily be imported into <em>Subsurface</em>.
CSV files are normally organised into
a single line that provides the headers of the data columns, followed by the
data, one record per line. CSV files can be opened with a normal text editor.
Following is a highly simplified and shortened example of a CSV file from an

<div class="olist loweralpha"><ol class="loweralpha">
<li>
<p>
Which character separates the different columns within a single line of
data? This field separator should be either a comma (,) or a TAB character.
This can be determined by opening the file with a text editor. If it is
comma-delimited, then the comma
characters between the values are clearly visible. If no commas are evident and
the numbers are aligned,
the file is probably TAB-delimited (i.e. it uses a TAB as a field separator, as
in the above example).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Which data columns need to be imported into <em>Subsurface</em>?. The Dive Time and
Depth columns are always required. Open the file using a text editor and note
the titles of the columns to be imported and their column positions. For
instance for the above example:
</p>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>Time:           column 1

rebreathers. If the user&#8217;s dive computer is on this list, it should be selected
using the dropdown
box labeled <em>Pre-configured imports</em>. Finally the <em>OK</em> should be clicked and
the dive will be imported and listed in the <strong>Dive List</strong> tab of <em>Subsurface</em>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If the dive computer is not on the pre-configured list, the user must
select the <em>Field

character, and could be determined by opening the file with a text
editor. If it is comma-delimited, then the comma
characters between the values are clearly visible. If no commas are evident and
the data
are in clear columns, the file
is probably TAB-delimited (i.e. it uses a TAB as a field separator, as in the
above example).
A recommended field separator for the export is tab, as commas might be used in
the
field values themselves.

</li>
<li>
<p>
Which columns need to be imported into <em>Subsurface</em>?. We do not
currently have any mandatory input fields, but some, e.g. dive duration
are crucial for the log file to make any sense. Possible options
can be seen in the image below and one should include all the
fields available in both your log file and in the Subsurface
import.

<div class="paragraph"><p>The profile also includes depth readings for the peaks and troughs in the graph.
Thus, users should see the depth of the deepest point and other peaks. Mean depth
is marked with a horizontal red line.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>air consumption</strong> graph displays the tank pressure and its change during the
dive. The air consumption takes depth into account so that even when manually
entering the start and end pressures the graph is not a straight line.
Similarly to the depth graph the slope of the tank pressure gives the user information
about the
momentary SAC rate (Surface Air Consumption) when using an air integrated dive computer.
Here the colour
coding is not relative to some absolute values but relative to the average
normalised air consumption during the dive. So areas that are red or orange
indicate
times of increased normalized air consumption while dark green reflects times
when the diver was using less gas than average. The colour coding is obviously
only possible when a tank sensor is connected and tank pressure readings during
the dive are available.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Water temperature</strong> is displayed with its own blue line with temperature values
placed adjacent to significant changes.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It is possible to <strong>zoom</strong> into the profile graph. This is done either by using
the scroll wheel / scroll gesture of your mouse or trackpad. By default
<em>Subsurface</em> always shows a profile area large enough for at least 30 minutes
and 30m
 (100ft) – this way short or shallow dives are intuitively recognizable;
something
that free divers clearly won’t care about.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/MeasuringBar.png" alt="FIGURE: Measuring Bar" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Measurements of <strong>depth differences</strong> can be achieved by using the button with
two vertical bars at the right of the dive profile panel (users should refer to
the above figure,
bottom right). The measurement is done by dragging the red dots to the two points
on the dive profile that the user wishes to measure. Information is then given
along the line connecting the
two red dots.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The dive profile can include further information that is typically more
interesting for tec divers. Enabling these is described in the section entitled
<em>Setting up Preferences</em>. Basically, users can include graphs of the <strong>partial
pressures</strong>
of O2, N2, and He during the dive as well as a calculated and dive computer
reported deco ceilings (only visible for deep, long, or repetitive dives). The
partial pressure graphs are added below the profile data, the calculated ceiling
is shown as a green overlay on top of the dive profile. Above the profile the
currently used gradient factors are shown (e.g. GF 35/75). Please note that
these are NOT the gradient factors in use by the dive computer in question,
but the gradient factors used by <em>Subsurface</em> to calculate deco obligations
during the dive.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The graph can also include the dive computer reported <strong>ceiling</strong> (or more
precisely, the first deco stop that the dive computer recorded – users are reminded that not
all dive computers record this information and make it available for download;
for example all of the Suunto dive computers fail to make this very useful data
available to divelog software). Because of the differences in used algorithms
and amount of data available (and factors taken into consideration) at the time
of the calculation it is unlikely that both of these are the same; this can be
true even if the same algorithm and <em>gradient factors</em> (see below) are used.
It is also quite common that <em>Subsurface</em> calculates a ceiling for
non-decompression dives when the dive computer stayed in non-deco mode during
the whole dive (represented by the <span class="green">dark green</span> section in the profile
at the beginning of this section). This is caused by the fact that
<em>Subsurface’s</em>
calculations describe the deco obligation at that point in time during a dive,
while dive computers usually take the upcoming ascent into account. During the
ascent some excess Nitrogen (and possibly Helium) are already breathed off so
even
though the diver technically encountered a ceiling at depth, the dive still does
not require an explicit deco stop. This feature allows dive computers to offer
longer non-stop bottom time.</p></div>

mouse cursor is over the Dive Profile panel. The menu allows the creation of
Bookmarks or Gas Change Event markers other than the ones that might have been
imported from a Dive Computer. Markers are placed against the depth profile line
and with the time of the event set by where the mouse cursor was when the right
mouse button was initially clicked to bring up the menu. Gas Change events
open a further selection of which gas is being switched to, the list based on
the available gases defined in the Equipment Tab. By right-clicking while over
an existing marker, the menu extends adding options to allow deletion of the
marker or to allow all markers of that type to be hidden. Hidden events can be
restored to view by selecting Unhide all events from the context menu.</p></div>

<h3 id="_the_strong_information_box_strong">4.5. The <strong>Information Box</strong></h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Information box displays a large range of information pertaining to the dive

Profile</strong> panel. If the mouse points outside of the <strong>Dive Profile</strong> panel, then
only the top line of the Information Box is visible (see left-hand part of
figure (A) below). The Information Box can be moved around in the <strong>Dive Profile</strong>
panel by click-dragging it with the mouse so that it is not obstructing
important detail. The position of the Information Box is saved and used again
during subsequent dive analyses.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The moment the mouse points inside the <strong>Dive Profile</strong> panel, it expands and
shows many data items. In this situation, the data reflect the time point along
the dive profile indicated by the mouse (see right-hand part of figure (B) above
where the Information Box reflects the situation at the position of the cursor
[arrow] in that image). Therefore, moving the cursor in the horizontal
direction allows the Information Box to show information for any point along the
dive profile.
In this mode, the Information Box gives extensive statistics about depth, gas
and ceiling characteristics of the particular dive. These include: Time period
into the dive (indicated by a @), depth, cylinder pressure (P), temperature,
ascent/descent rate, surface air consumption (SAC), oxygen partial pressure,
maximum operating depth, effective air depth (EAD), effective narcotic depth
(END), equivalent air density depth (EADD), decompression requirements at that
instant in time (Deco), time to surface (TTS), the calculated ceiling, as well
as the calculated ceiling for several Bühlmann tissue compartments.</p></div>

added to the dive list the numbering does not automatically follow on because
of the dives that are more recent in date/time than the newly-added dive that
has an older date/time. Therefore, one may sometimes need to renumber the dives.
This is performed by selecting (from the Main Menu) <em>Log &#8594; Renumber</em>. Users are

<h2 id="S_PrintDivelog">7. Printing a dive log</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Subsurface</em> provides a simple interface to print a whole dive log or only a
few selected dives, including dive profiles and other contextual information.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Before printing, two decisions are required:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Should the whole dive log be printed or only part of it? If only part of the
dive log is required, then the user must select the required dives from the <strong>Dive List</strong> panel.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
What gas partial pressure information is required on the dive profile? Users should select
the appropriate information from the Main Menu: <em>File&#8594;Preferences&#8594;Graph</em>.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now the print options should be selected to match the user&#8217;s needs. To do this, user should select <em>File&#8594;Print</em> from
the Main menu. The following dialogue appears (see the image on the left [A],
below).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Under <em>Print type</em> users need to select one of three options:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Print the Dive List: to do this, <em>Table Print</em> should be selected.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Print the full dive records (dive profiles and all other information) at 6
dives per printed page: to do this, users should select <em>6 dives per page</em>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Print the full dive records (dive profiles and all other information) at 2
dives per printed page: to do this, users should select <em>2 dives per page</em>.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Under <em>Print options</em> users need to select:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Printing only the dives that have been selected from the dive list prior to
activating the print dialogue, achieved by checking the box <em>Print only
selected dives</em>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Printing in colour, achieved by checking the box with <em>Print in color</em>.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <em>Ordering</em> affects the layout of the page (or part of it) for each dive.
The dive profile could be printed at the top of each dive, with the textual
information underneath, or it could be printed with the textual information at
the top with the dive profile underneath. Users should select the appropriate option in the
print dialogue. See the image on the right (<strong>B</strong>), above which has a layout with
text above the dive profile.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Users can <em>Preview</em> the printed page by selecting the <em>Preview</em> button on the
dialogue. After preview, changes to the options in the print dialogue can be
made, resulting in a layout that fits personal taste.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/PrintDiveLog.jpg" alt="FIGURE: Print dialogue" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Next, select the <em>Print</em> button in the dialogue. This activates the regular print
dialogue used by the user operating system (image [<strong>B</strong>] in the middle, above),
allowing them to choose a printer and to set its properties (image [<strong>C</strong>] on the right,
above).
It is important to set the print resolution of the printer to an appropriate value by
changing
the printer properties. Finally, users can print their dives. Below is a (rather small)
example of
the output for one particular page.</p></div>

<p>
<strong>Show</strong>: Here users can specify the amount of information shown as part of
the dive profile:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Gas pressure graphs: <em>Subsurface</em> can display the nitrogen, oxygen and the helium partial pressures during
the dive. For each of these graphs users can specify a threshold value on the right-hand side of the
panel. If any of the graphs go above this threshold level, the graph is
highlighted in red, indication that the threshold value has been exceeded (see
figure below).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Ceiling: Ascent ceilings arise when a direct ascent to the surface increases
the risk of a diver suffering from decompression sickness (DCS) and it is necessary to either ascend
slower or to perform decompression stop(s) before ascending to the surface.
<em>Subsurface</em> can indicate these ceilings above which the diver should not ascend
at a particular point in time (see the green-shaded areas in the figure in the
section on <a href="#S_DiveProfile">Dive Profiles</a>) and in the figure below:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
If the <strong>Calculated ceiling</strong> option is checked, then a ceiling is shown if it exists for
a particular dive (<strong>A</strong> in figure below)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If the <strong>show all tissues</strong> option is checked, the ceiling is shown for the tissue
compartments following the Bühlmann model (<strong>B</strong> in figure below).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If the <strong>3m increments</strong> option is checked, then the ceiling is indicated in 3 m increments
(<strong>C</strong> in figure below).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If the dive computer itself calculates a ceiling and makes it available to
<em>Subsurface</em> during upload of dives, this can be
shown by checking <strong>Dive computer reported ceiling</strong> and it can be drawn in red by
checking <strong>Draw ceiling red</strong>.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If a <em>Maximum operating depth (MOD)</em> or an <em>Equivalent air depth (EAD)</em>
applies to a dive profile, these can be shown by checking the appropriate boxes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If a <em>Maximum partial pressure of oxygen (maxPPO2)</em> applies to dives, then
this can be specified in the appropriate text box. In addition, if a
<em>no-decompression limit (NDL)</em> is to be shown in the <strong>info</strong> box, then users must check the
appropriate box.

<p>
<strong>Misc</strong>: Here users can set the <em>gradient factors</em> used while diving. GF_Low is
the gradient factor at deep and GF_High is used just below the surface.
At intermediate depths gradient factors between GF_Low and GF_High are used.
Gradient factors add conservatism to the nitrogen exposure during a dive, in a
similar way that many dive computers have a conservatism setting. The lower
the value of a gradient factor, the more conservative the calculations are with
respect to nitrogen loading and the deeper the ascent ceilings are. Gradient
factors of 25/60 are considered conservative and values of 60/90 are considered
harsh. Checking <strong>GFLow at max depth</strong> box causes GF_Low to be used at the
deepest depth of a dive. For more information see:

<div class="paragraph"><p>Note: If you have issues downloading from your dive computer in other software

<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">On MacOS:</div><p>Click on the Bluetooth symbol in the menu bar and select <em>Set up
Bluetooth Device&#8230;</em>. Make sure that your dive computer is in upload

through the pairing process. This step should only be needed once for
initial setup.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Once the pairing is completed the correct device will be shown in the
<em>Device or Mount Point</em> drop down in the <em>Subsurface</em> <strong>Import</strong> dialog.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">On Linux</div><p>Ensure bluetooth is enabled on the <em>Subsurface</em> computer.
On most common distributions this should be true out of the box. If not then
depending on your system, running <code>initd</code> or <code>systemd</code>. This might be different
and also involve loading modules specific to your hardware. In case your system
is
running <code>systemd</code>, manually run <code>sudo systemctl start bluetooth.service</code> to
enable
it, in case of <code>initd</code>, run something like <code>sudo rc.config start bluetoothd</code> or
<code>sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth start</code>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Pairing should be straight forward. Using Gnome3 for instance will show a
bluetooth icon in the upper right corner of the desktop where one selects <em>Set
up New Device</em>. This should show a dialog where one can select the
dive computer (in bluetooth mode) and pair it. For issues with PIN
setting try manually setting <em>0000</em>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>One may also use a manual approach by using such commands:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<code>sudo hciconfig</code> - shows the bluetooth devices available on your
computer (not dive computer), most likely one will see a hci0, if not
try <em>sudo hcitool -a</em> to see inactive devices and try to run <em>sudo
hciconfig hci0 up</em> to bring them up
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>sudo hcitool scanning</code>- use this to get a list of bluetooth enabled
client devices, look for the dive computer and remember the MAC
address shown there
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>sudo bluez-simple-agent hci0 10:00:E8:C4:BE:C4</code> - this will pair
the dive computer with the bluetooth stack of the <em>Subsurface</em> computer, copy/paste
the MAC address from the output of <em>hcitool scanning</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Unfortunately on Linux binding to a communication device has to be done
manually by running:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<code>sudo rfcomm bind /dev/rfcomm0 10:00:E8:C4:BE:C4</code> - bind the dive
computer to a communication device in the desktop computer, in case rfcomm is
already taken just use rfcomm1 or up, please copy/paste the MAC address
from the output of <em>hcitool scanning</em>, the MAC shown in here will not
work.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For downloading dives in Subsurface one then has to specify <code>/dev/rfcomm0</code>
as device name to use.</p></div>

<td class="content">Things are very similar to a normal USB-connected dive computer when
downloading dives from a Uemis Zurich
dive computer (one of the ones that recharge when
connected to the USB port). The main difference is that one does not enter a
device name, but instead the location where the UEMISSDA file system is
mounted once you connect the dive computer. On Windows this is a drive letter (
often <em>E:</em> or <em>F:</em>), on a Mac this is
<em>/Volumes/UEMISSDA</em> and on Linux systems this differs depending on the
distribution. On Fedora it usually is
<em>/var/run/media/&lt;your_username&gt;/UEMISSDA</em>. In all cases <em>Subsurface</em>
should suggest the correct location in the drop down list.</td>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Once onehas selected this as device name one can download the
dives from the Uemis Zurich. One technical issue with the Uemis Zurich
download implementation (this is a firmware limitation, not a
<em>Subsurface</em> issue) is that one cannot download more than about 40-50
dives without running out of memory on the SDA. This will usually only
happen the very first time one downloads dives from the Uemis Zurich -
normally when downloading at the end of a day or even after a dive
trip, the capacity is sufficient. If <em>Subsurface</em> displays an error
that the dive computer ran out of space the solution is straight
forward.  Disconnect the SDA, turn it off and on again, and reconnect
it. You can now retry (or start a new download session) and the
download will continue where it stopped previously. One
may have to do this more than once, depending on how many dives are
stored on the dive computer.</p></div>

<h3 id="_subsurface_appears_to_miscalculate_gas_consumption_and_sac">13.1. Subsurface appears to miscalculate gas consumption and SAC</h3>
<div class="paragraph" id="SAC_CALCULATION"><p>Not really. What happens is that subsurface actually calculates gas
consumption differently - and better - than you expect.
In particular, it takes the incompressibility of the gas into account.
Traditionally, Gas consumption and SAC should be:
<code>consumption = tank size x (start pressure - end pressure)</code></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>and that&#8217;s true for an ideal gas, and it&#8217;s what you get taught in dive theory.
But an "ideal gas" doesn&#8217;t actually exist, and real gases actually don&#8217;t compress
linearly with pressure. Also, you are missing the fact that one atmosphere of
pressure isn&#8217;t actually one bar.
So the <strong>real</strong> calculation is:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><code>consumption = (amount_of_air_at_beginning - amount_of_air_at_end)</code></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>where the amount of air is <strong>not</strong> just "tank size times pressure in bar".
It&#8217;s a combination of: "take compressibility into account" (which is a fairly
small issue under 220 bar - you&#8217;ll see more differences when you do high-pressure
tanks with 300bar) and "convert bar to atm" (which is the majority of your discrepancy).
Remember: one ATM is ~1.013 bar, so without the compressibility, your gas use is:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><code>12.2*((220-100)/1.013)</code></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>which is about 1445, not 1464. So there was 19 l too much in your simple
calculation that ignored the difference between 1 bar and one ATM.
The compressibility does show up above 200 bar, and takes that 1445 down
about eight liters more, so you really did use only about 1437 l of air at surface pressure.
The math details can be seen in dive.c:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><code>surface_volume_multiplier().</code></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The "if (bar &gt; 200) bar = .." part is the compressibility - it&#8217;s an approximation,
but it&#8217;s a reasonably good one, and closer to reality than not doing it.
You can get the numbers you expect if you remove that, and turn the function into just:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><code>return pressure.mbar / 1000.0;</code></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>but that would actually be wrong.
So be happy: your SAC really is better than your calculations indicated.
Or be sad: your cylinder contains less air than you thought it did.
And as mentioned, the "contains less air than you thought it did" really
starts becoming much more noticeable at high pressure. A 400 bar really does not
contain twice as much air as a 200 bar one. At lower pressures, air acts pretty much like an ideal gas.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_some_dive_profiles_have_time_discrepances_with_the_recorded_samples_from_my_dive_computer_8230">13.2. Some dive profiles have time discrepances with the recorded samples from my dive computer&#8230;</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Subsurface</em> ends up ignoring surface time for many things (average depth, divetime, SAC, etc).
 For example, if you end up doing a weight check (deep enough to trigger the "dive started")
but then come back up and wait five minutes for your buddies, your dive computer may say
that your dive is 50 minutes long - because you have fifty minutes worth of samples - but
subsurface will say it&#8217;s 45 minutes - because you were actually diving for 45 minutes.
It&#8217;s even more noticeable if you do things like divemastering the initial OW dives, when
you may stay in the water for a long time, but spend most of it at the surface. And then
 you don&#8217;t want that to count as some kind of long dive”.</p></div>
