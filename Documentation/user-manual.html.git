<div class="paragraph"><p>Welcome as a user of <em>Subsurface</em>, an advanced dive logging programme with
extensive infrastructure to describe, organise and interpret scuba and free dives.
<em>Subsurface</em> binaries are available for Windows PCs (Win XP or later), Intel
based Macs (OS/X) and many Linux distributions. <em>Subsurface</em> can be built for
many more hardware platforms and software environments where Qt and libdivecomputer
are available.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The scope of this document is the use of the <em>Subsurface</em> program. To install
the software, consult the <em>Downloads</em> page on the
<a href="http://subsurface.hohndel.org/"><em>Subsurface</em> web site</a>.
Please discuss issues with this program by sending an email to
<a href="mailto:subsurface@hohndel.org">our mailing list</a> and report bugs at
<a href="http://trac.hohndel.org">our bugtracker</a>.  For instructions on how to build the
software and (if needed) its dependencies please consult the INSTALL file
included with the source code.</p></div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="S_StartUsing">1. Start Using the Program</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <em>Subsurface</em> window is usually divided into four panels and has a <strong>Main
Menu</strong> (File Import Log View Filter Help) at the top of the window (for Windows
and Linux) or the top of the screen (for Mac and Ubuntu Unity). The screen shots
in this manual were taken on an Ubuntu system, so they don&#8217;t show the main menu
as part of the <em>Subsurface</em> window. The four panels are:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>1) The <strong>Dive List</strong> to the bottom left containing a list of all the dives in your
dive log. You can select and highlight a dive on the dive list by clicking on
it. In most situations you can also use the cursor up/down keys to switch
between dives.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>2) The <strong>Dive Map</strong> to the bottom right, showing your dive sites on a world map
and centred on the site of the last selected dive.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>3) The <strong>Dive Info</strong> to the top left, giving more detailed information on the
selected dive, including some statistics for the selected dive or for all
highlighted dive(s).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>4) The <strong>Dive Profile</strong> to the top right, showing a graphical profile of the
highlighted dive in the dive list.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can drag the dividers between panels in order to change the size of any of
the panels. <em>Subsurface</em> remembers the position of the dividers, so the next
time <em>Subsurface</em> starts it uses the positions of the dividers when the program
was executed previously.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If one dive is selected, the dive location, detailed information and profile of
the <em>selected dive</em> are shown in the respective panels. On the other hand, if
one highlights more than one dive the last highlighted dive is the <em>selected
dive</em>, but summary data of all <em>highlighted dives</em> is shown in the <strong>Stats</strong> tab
of the <strong>Dive Info</strong> panel.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" id="S_ViewPanels" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/main_window.jpg" alt="The Main Window" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can determine which of the four panels you wish to see by selecting the
<strong>View</strong> option on the main menu and which gives the user several choices of
display:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>All</strong>: show all four of the panels as in the screenshot above.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Divelist</strong>: Show only the Dive List.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Profile</strong>: Show only the Dive Profile of the selected dive.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Info</strong>: Show only the Dive Notes about the last selected dive and statistics for
all highlighted dives.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Globe</strong>: Show only the world map, centred on the last selected dive.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Like many other functions that can be accessed via the Main Menu, these options
can be triggered using keyboard shortcuts as well. The shortcuts for your system
are shown with an underline in the menu entries. Since different Operating
Systems and your chosen language may cause <em>Subsurface</em> to use different
shortcut keys we won&#8217;t try to list them here in the user manual.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When you start the program for the first time, it shows no information at all.
This is because the program doesn&#8217;t have any dive information available. In the
following sections we will describe how to create a new logbook.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="S_NewLogbook">2. Creating a new logbook</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Select <em>File &#8594; New Logbook</em> from the main menu. All existing dive data are
cleared so that new information can be added. If there is unsaved data in an open
logbook, <em>Subsurface</em> will ask you if you want to save the open logbook before
a new logbook is created.</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="S_GetInformation">3. How to obtain dive information to store in your logbook</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are several ways to add dive information to your logbook:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
Enter dive information by hand. This is typically useful if the diver did not
use a dive computer and dives were recorded in a written logbook.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Import dive information directly from a dive computer if it is supported by
<em>Subsurface</em>. The latest list of dive computers supported by <em>Subsurface</em> can
be found at:

<h3 id="S_EnterData">3.1. Entering dive information by hand</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is usually the approach for dives without a dive computer. The basic record
of information within <em>Subsurface</em> is a dive. The most important information
in a simple written dive logbook usually includes dive type, date, time,
duration, depth, the names of your dive buddy and of the dive master or dive guide,
and some remarks about the dive. <em>Subsurface</em> can store much more information
than this for each dive. In order to add a dive to your dive log, select <em>Log
&#8594; Add Dive</em> from the Main Menu. The program then shows three panels to enter
information for a dive: two tabs in the <strong>Info</strong> panel (<strong>Dive Notes</strong> and
<strong>Equipment</strong>), as well as the <strong>profile</strong> panel that displays a graphical profile of
each dive. These panels are respectively marked <span class="red">A</span>, <span class="red">B</span> and <span class="red">C</span>
in the figure below. We will now consider each of the tabs used for data entry.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_dive_notes">3.1.1. Dive Notes</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This panel contains the date, time and place information for a particular dive,
environmental conditions, co-divers and buddies, as well as some descriptive
information. The message in a blue box at the top of the panel indicates that
you are in the process of adding information about your dive. If you click on
the <strong>Dive Notes</strong> tab, the following fields are visible:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/AddDive2.jpg" alt="FIGURE: The Dive Notes tab" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>Starttime</strong> field reflects the date and the time of the dive. By clicking
the down-arrow on the right of that field you can display a calendar from which
you can choose the correct date. The hour and minutes values can also be edited
by clicking on each of them in the text box and by overtyping the information
displayed.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Air and water temperatures</strong>: Type in the air and water temperatures during the
dive into these fields to the right of the Starttime. You do not need to type
in units of temperature: Subsurface supplies these automatically, you only need
type the number. (The units selected in the <em>Preferences</em> <span class="red"><a id="URL link"></a></span>
will determine whether metric or imperial units are displayed)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Location</strong>: Here you enter the name of the dive site, e.g. "Tihany, Lake Balaton,
Hungary". Auto completion of location names will make this easier when you
frequently dive at the same sites.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Coordinates</strong>: The geographic coordinates of the dive site should be entered
here. These can come from three sources:</p></div>
<div class="olist loweralpha"><ol class="loweralpha">
<li>
<p>
You can enter the coordinates by hand if you happen to know what they are.
You need to enter them as decimal degrees, e.g: N30° 13.49760' , E30° 49.30788'.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
You can find the coordinates on the world map in the bottom right hand part
of the Subsurface window. The map displays a green bar indicating "No location
data - move the map and double-click to set the location". Upon a double-click
at the appropriate place, the green bar disappears and the coordinates are
stored.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
You can obtain the coordinates from the <em>Subsurface</em> Companion app if you
have an Android device with GPS and you stored the coordinates of the dive site
using that device.

<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Divemaster</strong>: Enter the name of the dive master or dive guide for this dive.
Again, this field offers auto completion based on the list of dive masters in the
current logbook.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Buddy</strong>: Enter the name(s) of the buddy / buddies who accompanied you on the
dive. Auto completion based on the list of buddies in the current logbook is
offered.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Suit</strong>: Enter the type of diving suit you used for the dive. Just as with the
other items auto completion of the suit description is available.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Rating</strong>: Here you can provide a subjective overall rating of the dive on a
5-point scale by clicking the appropriate star on the rating scale.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Visibility</strong>: You can provide a rating of visibility during the dive on a
5-point scale by clicking the appropriate star.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Tags</strong>: You may enter tags here (separate them by commas) that describe the type
of dive you performed. Examples of common tags are boat, drift, training, cave
etc. <em>Subsurface</em> has many built-in tags. Auto completion is once again offered.
For instance, if you typed <code>cav</code>, then the tags <strong>cave</strong> and <strong>cavern</strong> are shown
for the user to choose from.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Notes</strong>: Type any additional information here.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>Save</strong> and <strong>Cancel</strong> buttons are used to save all the information for tabs in
the info panel and in the dive profile panel, so there&#8217;s no need to use them
until ALL other information has been added. Here is an example of a completed
Dive Notes panel:</p></div>

dive. This is a highly interactive part of <em>Subsurface</em> and the information on
cylinders and gases (entered here) determines the behaviour of the dive profile
(top right-hand panel).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Cylinders</strong>: The cylinder information is entered through a dialogue that looks
like this:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/CylinderDataEntry1.jpg" alt="FIGURE:Initial cylinder dialogue" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The + button at the top right allows you to add more cylinders for this dive.
The dark dustbin icon on the left allows you to delete information for a
cylinder.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Start by selecting a cylinder type. The AL80 cylinder is shown as the default
cylinder type (you can change this default in the preferences if you usually
dive with a different type of tank). If you wish to change the tank used on this
dive, click on the AL80. This will bring up a dropdown list, accessible through
a down-arrow:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/CylinderDataEntry2.jpg" alt="FIGURE:The cylinder drop-down list button" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Use the drop-down list to select the cylinder type you used for this dive. The
<strong>Size</strong> of the cylinder as well as its working pressure (<strong>WorkPress</strong>) will auto
matically be shown in the dialogue.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now you need to indicate the starting pressure and the ending pressure of the
gas used during your dive. The unit of pressure (metric/imperial) corresponds
to the setting you chose in the preferences <span class="red"><a id="LINK"></a></span>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Finally you need to type in the gas mixture that you used. If you used air, you
can enter 21% or leave the field blank. If you used nitrox or trimix, specify
the percentage of oxygen and the percentage of helium. Leave any inappropriate
fields empty. Add information for any additional cylinders by using the + button
at the top right hand. Here is an example of a complete description for a
dive using two cylinders (air and EAN40):</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Weights</strong>: Information about the weight system used during a dive can be entered
using a dialogue very similar to that of the cylinder information. If you
click the + button on the top right of the weights dialogue, the table looks like
this:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Use the drop-down list to select your type of weight system. In the <strong>Weight</strong>
field, type in the weight used during the dive. It is possible to enter
information for more than one weight system by adding an additional system using
the + button on the top right hand. Weight systems can be deleted using the dustbin
icon on the left hand. Here is an example of information for a dive with two
types of weights: integrated and a weight belt:</p></div>

profile.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_creating_a_dive_profile">3.1.3. Creating a Dive Profile</h4>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>Dive Profile</strong> (a graphical representation of the depth of your dive as a
function of time) is indicated in the panel on the top right hand of the
<em>Subsurface</em> window. When you manually add a dive to your logbook, <em>Subsurface</em>
presents a default dive profile that you need to modify to best represent the dive
being described:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/DiveProfile1.jpg" alt="FIGURE: Initial dive profile" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Modifying the dive profile</em>: When you move the cursor around the dive profile,
its position is indicated by two red lines as shown below. The depth and time
that the cursor represents are indicated, respectively on the left hand and
bottom axes. The units (metric/imperial) on the axes are determined by the
<strong>preference</strong> settings <span class="red"><a id="LINK"></a></span>. The dive profile itself comprises several
line segments demarcated by waypoints (white dots on the profile, as shown
above). The default dive depth is 15m.
If your dive depth was 21m then you need to drag the appropriate waypoints
downwards to represent 21m. To add a waypoint, double-click on any line segment.
To remove a waypoint, right-click on it and choose "Remove this point" from the
context menu. You will also need to drag the waypoints to represent an accurate
time duration for your dive. Below is a dive profile that represents a dive
to 21m for 31 min., followed by a 3 minute safety stop at 5m.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><em>Specifying the gas composition:</em> The gas composition used is clearly indicated
along the line segments of the dive profile. This defaults to the first gas
mixture specified in the <strong>Equipment</strong> tab, which was air in the case of the
profile illustrated above. The gas mixtures of segments of the dive profile can be
edited. This is done by clicking on the gas description for a particular
waypoint and selecting the appropriate choice from the context menu. Changing the
gas for a waypoint affects the gas shown in the segment <em>to the left</em> of that
waypoint. Note that only the gases defined in the <strong>Equipment</strong> tab appear in the
context menu:</p></div>

PC-Communication mode. <strong>This could drain your battery</strong>. We therefore
recommend that you check if your dive computer is recharging when
connected to the USB port of a PC. For example, several Suunto and Mares dive
computers do not recharge through the USB connection. Please consult the manual

<div class="paragraph"><p>To import dive information from a dive computer to your computer with <em>Subsurface</em>,
it is necessary that the two pieces of equipment must communicate. This
involves setting up the communications port (or mount point) of the computer
with <em>Subsurface</em> that communicates with the dive computer. In order to set up
this communication, you need to find the appropriate information to instruct
<em>Subsurface</em> where and how to import the dive information. <strong>Appendix A</strong> provides
the technical information to help you achieve this for different operating
systems and <strong>Appendix B</strong> has dive computer specific information.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now it is time to hook up your dive computer to your PC:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>

<li>
<p>
Put your dive computer into PC Communication mode.
        (You should consult the manual of your specific dive computer for
your brand and type)

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Dive computers tend to keep a certain number of dives in their memory, even
though these dives have already been imported to <em>Subsurface</em>. For that reason
<em>Subsurface</em> only imports dives that have not been uploaded before. This makes
the download process faster on most dive computers and also saves battery power
of your dive computer (at least for those not charging while connected via USB).
If, for some reason, you wish to import ALL dives from the dive computer,
even though some may already be in the logbook, you can tick the box labeled
<em>Force download of all dives</em>.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The dialogue has two drop-down lists, <strong>Vendor</strong> and <strong>Dive Computer</strong>. On the
<strong>vendor</strong> drop-down list select the make of your computer, e.g. Suunto, Oceanic,
Uwatec, Mares. On the <strong>Dive Computer</strong> drop-down list, select the model name of
your dive computer, e.g. D4 (Suunto), Veo200 (Oceanic), or Puck (Mares).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The <strong>Device or Mount Point</strong> drop-down list contains the USB or Bluetooth port
name that <em>Subsurface</em> needs in order to communicate with your dive computer.
Select the appropriate port name. Consult <strong>Appendix A</strong> and <strong>Appendix B</strong> for
technical details to find the appropriate port information for your dive
computer and, in some cases, how to do the correct settings to the operating system
of your <em>Subsurface</em> computer.

<p>
If there is a problem in communicating with your dive computer, an error
message will be shown, similar to this text: "Unable to open /dev/ttyUSB0 Mares

<td class="content">In the case of <strong>communication failure</strong> then check the following:
1) Is the dive computer still in PC-communication or Upload mode?
2) Is the battery of the dive computer fully charged? If not then charge or
replace the battery.
3) Is the cable faulty? Does the cable work perfectly using other software? Has
it worked before, or is this the first time you are using the cable?
4) Consult <strong>Appendix A</strong> and make sure you specified the correct Mount Point
(see above). If your <em>Subsurface</em> computer does not recognise the USB adaptor by
showing an appropriate device name next to the Mount Point, then there is a
possibility that the cable or USB adaptor is faulty. A faulty cable is the most
common cause of communication failure between dive computer and <em>Subsurface</em>

<div class="paragraph" id="S_ImportingAlienDiveLogs"><p>Maybe you have a lot of dives logged using other dive log software. You don&#8217;t
have to type all information by hand into <em>Subsurface</em>, because you can probably
import your divelog. <em>Subsurface</em> will import divelogs from a range of other
dive log software. Some software is supported natively (e.g. divelogs.de,
JDiveLog, MacDive, and Suunto DM4), for others you have to export your logbook
to XML and then <em>Subsurface</em> can import that XML file (Suunto DM3, DivingLog).
<em>Subsurface</em> can also import UDDF and UDCF files that are used by some divelog
software and even some divecomputers like the Heinrichs &amp; Weikamp DR5. Finally,
for some divelog software we currently suggest to import your logbook first
into a webservice like <em>divelogs.de</em> and then import them from there with
<em>Subsurface</em>, as divelogs.de supports a few additional logbook formats that
<em>Subsurface</em> currently cannot parse.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When importing dives, <em>Subsurface</em> tries to detect multiple records for
the same dive and merges the information as best as it can. If
there are no time zone issues (or other reasons that would cause the
beginning time of the dives to be significantly different) <em>Subsurface</em>
will not create duplicate entries.</p></div>

Android device and dive information from your dive computer based on date-time
data, automatic assignment of GPS data to dives is dependent on agreement of
date and time between these two devices. If there is a large difference between
the time in your dive computer and the time in your Android device,
<em>Subsurface</em> is unable to identify the dive that matches a location and nothing
happens. Similar date-times may be not always be possible.  A dirty hack is
manually editing the date-time of a dive in Subsurface&#8217;s Dive List <em>before</em>
downloading the GPS data and then to edit the date-time back again <em>after</em>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The profile also includes depth readings for the peaks and troughs in the graph.
Thus you should see the depth of the deepest point and other peaks. Mean depth
is marked with a horizontal red line.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <strong>air consumption</strong> graph displays the tank pressure and its change during the
dive. The air consumption takes depth into account so that even when manually
entering the start and end pressures the graph is not a straight line.
Similarly to the depth graph the tank pressure gives you information about the
momentary SAC rate (Surface Air Consumption – often also called RMV – Respiratory
Minute Volume) when using an air integrated dive computer. Here the colour
coding is not relative to some absolute values but relative to the average
normalised air consumption during the dive. So areas that are red or orange indicate
times of increased normalized air consumption while dark green reflects times
when the diver was using less gas than average. The colour coding is obviously
only possible when a tank sensor is connected and tank pressure readings during
the dive are available.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Water temperature</strong> is displayed with its own blue line with temperature values
placed adjacent to significant changes.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It is possible to <strong>zoom</strong> into the profile graph. This is done either by using
the scroll wheel / scroll gesture of your mouse or trackpad. By default
<em>Subsurface</em> always shows a profile area large enough for at least 30 minutes and 30m
 (100ft) – this way short or shallow dives are intuitively recognizable; something
that free divers clearly won’t care about.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/MeasuringBar.png" alt="FIGURE: Measuring Bar" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Measurements of <strong>depth differences</strong> can be achieved by using the button with
two vertical bars at the right of the dive profile panel (see above figure,
bottom right). Drag the red dots to the two points on the dive profile which
you would like to measure. Information is given along the line connecting the
two red dots.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The dive profile can include further information that is typically more
interesting for tec divers. Enabling these is described in the section entitled
Setting up Preferences. Basically you can include graphs of the <strong>partial pressures</strong>
of O2, N2, and He during the dive as well as a calculated and dive computer
reported deco ceilings (only visible for deep, long, or repetitive dives). The
partial pressure graphs are added below the profile data, the calculated ceiling
is shown as a green overlay on top of the dive profile. Above the profile the
currently used gradient factors are shown (e.g. GF 35/75). Please note that
these are NOT the gradient factors in use by the dive computer in question,
but the gradient factors used by <em>Subsurface</em> to calculate deco obligations
during the dive.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The graph can also include the dive computer reported <strong>ceiling</strong> (or more
precisely, the first deco stop that the dive computer recorded – note that not
all dive computers record this information and make it available for download;
for example all of the Suunto dive computers fail to make this very useful data
available to divelog software). Because of the differences in used algorithms
and amount of data available (and factors taken into consideration) at the time
of the calculation it is unlikely that both of these are the same; this can be
true even if the same algorithm and <em>gradient factors</em> (see below) are used.
It is also quite common that <em>Subsurface</em> calculates a ceiling for
non-decompression dives when the dive computer stayed in non-deco mode during
the whole dive (represented by the <span class="green">dark green</span> section in the profile
at the beginning of this section). This is caused by the fact that <em>Subsurface’s</em>
calculations describe the deco obligation at that point in time during a dive,
while dive computers usually take the upcoming ascent into account. During the
ascent some excess Nitrogen (and possibly Helium) are already breathed off so even
though the diver technically encountered a ceiling at depth, the dive still does
not require an explicit deco stop. This feature allows dive computers to offer
longer non-stop bottom time.</p></div>

<h3 id="_the_dive_profile_context_menu">4.4. The Dive Profile context menu</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The context menu for the Dive Profile is accessed by right-clicking while the
mouse cursor is over the Dive Profile panel. The menu allows the creation of
Bookmarks or Gas Change Event markers other than the ones that might have been
imported from a Dive Computer. Markers are placed against the depth profile line
and with the time of the event set by where the mouse cursor was when the right
mouse button was initially clicked to bring up the menu. Gas Change events
open a further selection of which gas is being switched to, the list based on
the available gases defined in the Equipment Tab. By right-clicking while over
an existing marker, the menu extends adding options to allow deletion of the
marker or to allow all markers of that type to be hidden. Hidden events can be
restored to view by selecteing Unhide all events from the context menu.</p></div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_strong_information_box_strong">4.5. The <strong>Information Box</strong></h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Information box displays a large range of information pertaining to the dive
profile. Normally the Information Box is located to the top left of the <strong>Dive
Profile</strong> panel. If the mouse points outside of the <strong>Dive Profile</strong> panel, then
only the top line of the Information Box is visible (see left-hand part of
figure (A) below). The Information Box can be moved around in the <strong>Dive Profile</strong>
panel by click-dragging it with the mouse so that it is not obstructing
important detail. The position of the Information Box is saved and used again
during subsequent dive analyses.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/InfoBox2.jpg" alt="Figure: Information Box" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The moment the mouse points inside the <strong>Dive Profile</strong> panel, it expands and
shows many data items. In this situation, the data reflect the time point along
the dive profile indicated by the mouse (see right-hand part of figure (B) above
where the Information Box reflects the situation at the position of the cursor
[arrow] in that image). Therefore, moving the cursor in the horizontal
direction allows the Information Box to show information for any point along the
dive profile.
In this mode, the Information Box gives extensive statistics about depth, gas
and ceiling characteristics of the particular dive. These include: Time period
into the dive (indicated by a @), depth, cylinder pressure (P), temperature,
ascent/descent rate, surface air consumption (SAC), oxygen partial pressure,
maximum operating depth, effective air depth (EAD), effective narcotic depth
(END), equivalent air density depth (EADD), decompression requirements at that
instant in time (Deco), time to surface (TTS), the calculated ceiling, as well
as the calculated ceiling for several Bühlmann tissue compartments.</p></div>

<h3 id="S_Renumber">5.2. Renumbering the dives</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Dives are normally numbered incrementally from non-recent dives (low sequence
numbers) to recent dives (having the highest sequence numbers). The numbering
of the dives is not always consistent. For instance, when non-recent dives are
added to the dive list the numbering does not automatically follow on because
of the dives that are more recent in date/time than the newly-added dive that
has an older date/time. Therefore you sometimes may need to renumber the dives.
This is performed by selecting (from the Main Menu) <em>Log &#8594; Renumber</em>. You are
given a choice with respect to the lowest sequence number to be used.
Completing this operation results in new sequence numbers (based on date/time)
for the dives in the <strong>Dive List</strong> panel.</p></div>

<h3 id="S_Group">5.3. Grouping dives into trips and manipulating trips</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you dive regularly, the dive list can rapidly become very long. <em>Subsurface</em>
can group dives into <em>trips</em>. It performs this by grouping dives that have
date/times that are not separated in time by more than two days, thus creating
a single heading for each diving trip represented in the dive log. Below is an
ungrouped dive list (A, on the left) as well as a grouped dive list with

<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Lists and tables</strong>: Here you can specify the font type and font size of the
Dive Table panel. By decreasing the font size of the Dive table,
you can see more dives on a screen.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Dives</strong>: Here you need to specify the directory and file name of your
electronic dive log book. This is a file with filename extension .xml. When
launched, <em>Subsurface</em> will then automatically load the dive log book specified.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Display invalid</strong>:  Dives can be marked as invalid (when you want to hide
dives that you don&#8217;t consider valid dives, e.g. pool dives, but still want to
keep them in the dive log). This controls whether those dives are displayed in
the dive list.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Use Default cylinder</strong>: Here you can specify the default cylinder listed in
the <strong>Equipment</strong> tab of the <strong>Dive Notes</strong> panel.

a mixture with some measurements being metric while others are in imperial
measures.</p></div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_graph">9.3. Graph</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This panel allows two type of selections:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Show</strong>: Here you specify the amount of information that is shown as part of
the dive profile:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Gas pressure graphs: <em>Subsurface</em> can display the pressures of the gases
with which you dive. If you dive breathing air, then the only important gas is
nitrogen. You can instruct <em>Subsurface</em> to plot the nitrogen pressure during
your dive. If you dive breathing nitrox, then you can select a graph of both the
nitrogen and oxygen pressures during your dive. If you dive with trimix or
heliox, you can select the display of the helium pressure as well. For each of
these graphs you can specify a threshold value on the right-hand side of the
panel. If any of the graphs go above this threshold level, the graph is
highlighted in red, indication that the threshold value has been exceeded (see
figure below).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Ceiling: Ascent ceilings arise when a direct ascent to the surface exposes
the diver to decompression sickness (DCS) and it is necessary to either ascend
slower or to perform decompression stop(s) before ascending to the surface.
<em>Subsurface</em> can indicate these ceilings above which the diver should not ascend
at a particular point in time (see the green-shaded areas in the figure in the
section on <a href="#S_DiveProfile">Dive Profiles</a>) and in the figure below:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
If you check <strong>Calculated ceiling</strong>, then a ceiling is shown if it exists for
a particular dive (<strong>A</strong> in figure below)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If you check <strong>show all tissues</strong>, the ceiling is shown for the tissue
compartments following the Bühlmann model (<strong>B</strong> in figure below).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If you check <strong>3m increments</strong>, then the ceiling is indicated in 3m-increments
(<strong>C</strong> in figure below).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If the dive computer itself calculates a ceiling and makes it available to
<em>Subsurface</em> during upload of dives, this can be
shown by checking <strong>Dive computer reported ceiling</strong> and it can be drawn in red by
checking <strong>Draw ceiling red</strong>.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If a <em>Maximum operating depth (MOD)</em> or an <em>Equivalent air depth (EAD)</em>
applies to a dive profile, these can be shown by checking the appropriate boxes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If a <em>Maximum partial pressure of oxygen (maxPPO2)</em> applies to dives, then
this can be specified in the appropriate text box. In addition, if a
<em>no-decompression limit (NDL)</em> is to be shown in the <strong>info</strong> box, then check the
appropriate box.

</div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<strong>Misc</strong>: Here you can set the <em>gradient factors</em> used while diving. GF_Low is
the gradient factor at deep depths and GF_High is used just below the surface.
At intermediate depths gradient factors between GF_Low and GF_High are used.
Gradient factors add conservatism to the nitrogen exposure during a dive, in a
similar way that many dive computers have a conservatism setting. The lower
the value of a gradient factor, the more conservative the calculations are with
respect to nitrogen loading and the deeper the ascent ceilings are. Gradient
factors of 25/60 are considered conservative and values of 60/90 are considered
harsh. Checking <strong>GFLow at max depth</strong> box causes GF_Low to be used at the
deepest depth of a dive. For more information see:

<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">On Windows:</div><p>Bluetooth is most likely already enabled. For pairing the device choose
Control Panel&#8594;Bluetooth Devices&#8594;Add Wireless Device
This should bring up a dialog showing your dive computer (in Bluetooth mode) and
allowing to pair it. For bluetooth pairing of your dive computer refer to the
manufacturer&#8217;s user guide. The dive computer should then show up in the list of
Bluetooth devices and you may then right click on it and choose Properties&#8594;COM
Ports to identify the port used for your dive computer. If there are several
ports listed, use the one saying "Outgoing" instead of "Incoming".</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For downloading to <em>Subsurface</em>, the drop down list should contain this COM
port already. If not, enter it manually.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note: If you have issues downloading from your dive computer in other software
afterwards try to remove the pairing with your dive computer.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">On MacOS:</div><p>Click on the Bluetooth symbol in the menu bar and select <em>Set up
Bluetooth Device&#8230;</em>. Make sure that your dive computer is in upload
mode; it should then show up in the list of devices. Select it and go
through the pairing process. This step should only be needed once for
initial setup.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Once the pairing is completed the correct device will be shown in the
<em>Device or Mount Point</em> drop down in the <em>Subsurface</em> <strong>Import</strong> dialog.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">On Linux</div><p>Ensure sure bluetooth is enabled on the <em>Subsurface</em> computer.
On most common distributions this should be true out of the box. If not then
depending on your system, running <code>initd</code> or <code>systemd</code>. This might be different
and also involve loading modules specific to your hardware. In case your system is
running <code>systemd</code>, manually run <code>sudo systemctl start bluetooth.service</code> to enable
it, in case of <code>initd</code>, run something like <code>sudo rc.config start bluetoothd</code> or
<code>sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth start</code>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Pairing should be straight forward. Using Gnome3 for instance will show a
bluetooth icon in the upper right corner of your desktop where you select <em>Set
up New Device</em>. This should show you a dialog where you are able to select your
dive computer (in bluetooth mode) and pair it. If you have issues with PIN
setting try manually setting <em>0000</em>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You may also use a manual approach by using such commands:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<code>sudo hciconfig</code> - shows the bluetooth devices available on your
computer (not dive computer), most likely you will see a hci0, if not
try <em>sudo hcitool -a</em> to see inactive devices and try to run <em>sudo
hciconfig hci0 up</em> to bring them up
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>sudo hcitool scanning</code>- use this to get a list of bluetooth enabled
client devices, watch out for your dive computer and remember the MAC
address shown there
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>sudo bluez-simple-agent hci0 10:00:E8:C4:BE:C4</code> - this will pair
your dive computer with the bluetooth stack of your computer, copy/paste
the MAC address from the output of <em>hcitool scanning</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Unfortunately on Linux binding to a communication device has to be done
manually by running:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<code>sudo rfcomm bind /dev/rfcomm0 10:00:E8:C4:BE:C4</code> - bind the dive
computer to a communication device in your computer, in case rfcomm is
already taken just use rfcomm1 or up, please copy/paste the MAC address
from the output of <em>hcitool scanning</em>, the MAC shown in here will not
work for you.

dive computer (which certainly is one of the ones that DO recharge when
connected to the USB port). The main difference is that you don&#8217;t enter a
device name, but instead the location where the UEMISSDA file system is
mounted once you connect the dive computer. On Windows this is a drive letter (
often <em>E:</em> or <em>F:</em>), on a Mac this is
<em>/Volumes/UEMISSDA</em> and on Linux systems this differs depending on the
distribution that you use. On Fedora it usually is

<div class="paragraph"><p>Once you have selected this as device name you can download the

download implementation (this is a firmware limitation, not a
<em>Subsurface</em> issue) is that you cannot download more than about 40-50
dives without running out of memory on the SDA. This will usually only
happen the very first time you download dives from the Uemis Zurich -
normally when downloading at the end of a day or even after a dive
trip, the capacity is sufficient. If <em>Subsurface</em> displays an error
that the dive computer ran out of space the solution is straight
forward.  Disconnect the SDA, turn it off and on again, and reconnect
it. You can now retry (or start a new download session) and the
download will continue where it stopped the last time you tried. You
may have to do this more than once, depending on how many dives you
have stored on your dive computer.</p></div>
