Building the Qt version under Linux
-----------------------------------

On Debian you need libqt4-dev, libmarble-dev, libzip-dev.
Unfortunately the marble version in Debian stable (and possibly
Ubuntu) appears broken and missing essential header files used in the
current git version of Subsurface. We hack around this right now by
including this header file but this needs to be revisited before an
actual release.

On Fedora you need qt-devel, marble-devel, libzip-devel,
libxml2-devel, libxslt-devel, libsqlite3x-devel. If you are going to
compile libdivecomputer, you need to libusb-devel too.

On Debian the package names are different; try libxml2-dev,
libsqlite3-dev, libxslt1-dev, libzip-dev (and libusb-1.0-0-dev if
you're going to compile libdivecomputer).

To compile libdivecomputer:
$ git clone git://git.libdivecomputer.org/libdivecomputer
$ cd libdivecomputer
$ git checkout release-0.4
$ autoreconf --install
$ ./configure --disable-shared
$ make
$ sudo make install

To compile Subsurface:
$ git clone git://subsurface.hohndel.org/subsurface.git
$ cd subsurface
$ qmake
$ make
$ sudo make install     [optionally, add: prefix=/usr/local]

Building the Qt version under MacOSX
------------------------------------

1)  Install Homebrew

$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go/install)"

2) Install needed dependencies

$ brew install asciidoc libzip qt sqlite cmake libusb pkg-config

3) Make the brew version of sqlite the default

$ brew link --force sqlite

4) Install Marble

$ mkdir -p ~/src/marble/build
$ git clone -b KDE/4.11 git://anongit.kde.org/marble ~/src/marble/sources
$ cd ~/src/marble/build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DQTONLY=TRUE -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ../sources
$ cd src/lib
$ make -j4
$ cp *dylib /usr/local/lib/
$ mkdir -p /usr/local/include/marble
$ cd ../../../sources/src/lib
$ cp $(find . -name '*.h') /usr/local/include/marble/

5) Install Libdivecomputer

$ brew install automake libtool
$ cd ~/src
$ git clone git://git.libdivecomputer.org/libdivecomputer
$ cd libdivecomputer
$ git checkout release-0.4
$ autoreconf --install
$ ./configure --disable-shared
$ make
$ make install

6) Compile Subsurface

$ cd ~/src
$ git clone git://subsurface.hohndel.org/subsurface.git
$ cd subsurface
$ qmake
$ make
$ make install_mac_bundle

After the above is done, Subsurface will be installed to
/Applications.

Another option is to create a .dmg for distribution:

$ qmake
$ make
$ make mac-create-dmg

Cross-building Subsurface on Linux for Windows
----------------------------------------------

Subsurface builds nicely with MinGW - the official builds are done as
cross builds under Linux (currently on Fedora 17). A shell script to do
that (plus the .nsi file to create the installer with makensis) are
included in the packaging/Windows directory.

The best way to get libdivecomputer to build appears to be

$ git clone git://libdivecomputer.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/libdivecomputer/libdivecomputer
$ cd libdivecomputer
$ git checkout release-0.4
$ mingw32-configure --disable-shared
$ mingw32-make
$ sudo mingw32-make install

To compile Subsurface, use:

$ git clone git://subsurface.hohndel.org/subsurface.git
$ cd subsurface
$ i686-w64-mingw32-qmake-qt4
$ make
$ make install
$ make create-windows-installer

Building Subsurface on Windows
------------------------------

1) Install msys-git:
http://msysgit.github.io

Tools part of MSYS are required for building Subsurface, while you also
need Git to be upstream and contribute to the project.
Make sure that the msys/bin (or git/bin) folder is in PATH.

2) Install Qt
http://qt-project.org/downloads

Subsurface is currently built against Qt 4.8.5.

3) Install a MinGW toolchain
https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B4D8x6CJEmtuczdiQklwMEs4RUU

Qt 4.8.5 comes without a compiler and you will have to download it from
a separate location. Other compiler may work, but there are no guaranties for
that. Make sure that the mingw/bin folder is in PATH.

4) Install Libdivecomputer
Use similar steps to the previous section, without the sudo command.

5) Install CMake (required for building Marble):
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

Make sure that the cmake/bin folder is in PATH.

5) Download and build Marble
http://marble.kde.org/sources.php
http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Marble/WindowsCompiling#Compiling_Marble_using_MingW

Make sure you build both the Debug and Release versions.

6) Install pkg-config
http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/dependencies/pkg-config_0.26-1_win32.zip

pkg-config depends on DLL files such as libglib-2.0-0.dll and has to be in
PATH, so it's best that you copy the executable to msys/bin.

7) Install other dependencies
Subsurface also depends on the following libraries:

* libxml2
http://www.xmlsoft.org/downloads.html
* libxslt
http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/
* libusb-1.0
http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/libusb-win32/wiki
* zlib
http://www.zlib.net/
* libzip
http://www.nih.at/libzip/

Once you have the libraries, create .pc files (pkg-config) for them and place
the files in a folder that is indicated by the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment
variable - e.g. PKG_CONFIG_PATH=c:\msys\pkg-config

To build subsurface, use:

$ git clone git://subsurface.hohndel.org/subsurface.git
$ cd subsurface
$ qmake
$ make
$ make install
$ make create-windows-installer

Build options
-------------

The following options are recognised when passed to qmake:

 -config debug        Create a debug build
 -config release      Create a release build
                      The default depends on how Qt was built.
 V=1                  Disable the "silent" build mode
 LIBDCDEVEL=1         Search for libdivecomputer in ../libdivecomputer
 INCLUDEPATH+=xxx     Add xxx to the include paths to the compiler
                      (pass the actual path, without -I)
 LIBS+=xxx            Add xxx to the linker flags. -l and -L options are
                      recognised.

The INCLUDEPATH and LIBS options are useful to tell the buildsystem
about non-standard installation paths for the dependencies (such as
Marble). They can be repeated as often as needed, or multiple
arguments can be passed on the same switch, separated by a space. For
example:

  qmake LIBS+="-L$HOME/marble/lib -L$HOME/libdivecomputer/lib" \
        INCLUDEPATH+="$HOME/marble/include $HOME/libdivecomputer/include"
