			Subsurface 4.3 Beta 1
			=====================

Some of the changes since Subsurface 4.2

- Multi filter: filter the dive list by many criteria including tags,
  people who were on the dive, location, suit, etc
- Cut and paste support when editing dives: copy selected components
  of a dive and paste them into one or more other dives. This makes
  it easy to add the same equipment, buddies, tags or other aspects
  of a dive into others
- Tissue saturation visualization
- Configuration of the OSTC 2 and 3 as well as the Suunto Vyper
  family of dive computers
- Support for extra data that can be downloaded from some dive
  computers, including information like battery levels, no fly times,
  Gradient Factors used during the dive, etc (only as supported by the
  dive computer, at the time of this writing this requires a custom
  version of libdivecomputer oder a Uemis Zurich SDA)
- Better visualization of the gases used during a dive ("tank bar")
- Ability to re-plan dives
- Support for several new dive computers including the Suunto EON Steel,
  Aeris A300 CD, Aeris F11 (Suunto EON Steel support is included with the
  Windows binaries but requires a patched version of libdivecomputer when
  building from source -- we expect the necessary patches to be upstream,
  soon)
- Import dive logs from Liquivision and Cochran software
- Import dive logs from the Poseidon Mk6 CCR
- Import dive logs from Suunto DM5
- Many improvements for UDDF and CSV import
- Many improvements to HTML export
- Many small improvements to the planner
- Many small UI changes for better use on small displays (tighter columns
  and column headers on the dive list, the toolbox of icons no longer
  forces a minimum height of the profile, etc)
- Improvements on HiDPI displays
- Fix annoying bug where when starting to edit a dive the pop-up with
  completions would cover the edit line (this usually happened when
  editing tags)
- Declutter profile for dive computers that send a heading event in every
  sample
- on Windows, prevent installation of 64bit binaries on 32bit OS and warn
  when installing 32bit binaries on 64bit OS
- support multiple tanks when syncing with divelogs.de
- Experimental CCR and PSCR support: (someone explain what does and does not work, please)

Known bugs

- this appears to be a bug in Qt. When changing the password needed
  authenticate with a proxy, Subsurface will not use the new password
  until after a restart

			Subsurface 4.2
			==============

The Subsurface developer team is proud to announce the release of the
next update of Subsurface.

Subsurface is an open source divelog program that runs on Windows, Mac
and Linux.

With Subsurface the user can download dive information directly from a
large number of supported dive computers. Subsurface is able to track
single- and multi-tank dives using air, Nitrox or TriMix. It displays
a dive profile with all related information including air consumption
and alarms. It also allows logging of information like weights and
exposure protection used, dive masters and dive buddies, and enables
the user to rate dives and provide additional dive notes.

With Subsurface the user can track dive locations including GPS
coordinates (which can also be conveniently entered using a map
interface). Subsurface calculates a wide variety of statistics of the
user's diving and keeps track of information like the user's SAC rate,
partial pressures of O2, N2 and He, calculated deco information, and
many more.

Subsurface allows the user to print out a detailed log book including
dive profiles and other relevant information. The program is localized
in about 20 languages and well supported by an active developer
community. This community also made new and shiny offline manuals in
Spanish and Russian possible.

One of the major strengths of Subsurface is its support of a wide range
of dive computers (most common dive computers are supported with the help
of libdivecomputer); a detailed list is in the SupportedDivecomputers.txt
file. Subsurface can also import existing dive logs from several sources
including MacDive, Suunto DM3/DM4, JDiveLog and divelogs.de. Another
strength is its ability to visualize the depth profile (and, if
available, the tank pressure curve) in very innovative ways that give
the user additional information on relative velocity (and momentary
air consumption) during the dive through the coloring of the graphs.

Some of the changes since 4.1

- The Windows installer is now a 64bit installer including Qt5
- There is still a deprecated 32bit installer including Qt4, but that has
  several known issues (among others, printing has a number of bugs that
  were fixed in Qt5).
- The Mac installer has also been updated to Qt5
- A current development version of libdivecomputer is used for the Windows
  and Mac builds.
- A Dive Planner got added again, using the graphical profile editor; it
  supports different ascent speeds, backgas breaks during deco and many
  other interesting features; it allows the user to print just the dive
  plan (without graphic profile); one shortcoming is that currently one
  cannot re-plan a planned dive, i.e., once you save a dive plan, you can
  no longer edit / change the plan; you have to start from scratch again.
  This is on the todo list.
- Pictures can be associated with dives and shown in the profile
- Printing is much improved (but see above), including a "1 dive per page"
  mode, better rendering of dives (in our mind) and better data
  presented per dive.
- Data entry for dives is much more intuitive and consistent
- We have a reasonably functional HTML exporter for the dive log (it's
  still work in progress but already quite powerful, even though lacking
  localization support).
- Support to import dive log files from Seabear dive computers.
- We added a user survey to learn more about the interests and needs of
  out users
- improved and extended user manuals
- new translated user manuals in Spanish and Russian

Known issues:

- (Windows specific) Many Windows fonts don't support specific characters,
  specifically subscript "2" (eg in pOâ‚‚). New installations of Subsurface
  will automatically pick a font that contains this character, but if you
  had Subsurface installed on a specific system before, it likely has
  saved the previous font in its settings. In that case the best solution
  is to manually change the font to one that contains this character,
  e.g. Calibri.

- (Windows specific) When upgrading from Subsurface 4.1, after saving of a
  logfile the logfile's name may be listed a second time in the files menu
  because of a change in the representation of logfiles filename in the
  Windows registry.

- There are a number of small inconsistencies in the UI when editing
  multiple dives. For example, if multiple dives are edited and some of
  them already have coordinates set, under certain circumstances the
  changes aren't saved. To circumvent this bug only edit dives with the
  same coordinates or edit the dives individually.

- (Windows specific - only 64bit) If an ad blocker is used and set to
  offline mode, the manual check for an update crashes subsurface.

- When using the globe / map widget to edit dive locations, double clicks
  some times fail to set the correct position.

- Sometimes the globe will show the same pane several times. Try to zoom
  in or out of the location and give the system time to download the map
  tiles in the background - on slower network connections this can take a
  while.


New in version 4.1 (compared to Subsurface 4.0.3):
--------------------------------------------------

- new and improved profile widget with animations, better info box, and
  a new toolbox to turn on and off many of the additional graphs and
  information displays
- improved CSV import and added CSV export
- import of exported log files from Sensus (CSV) and Shearwater Desktop
  (XML)
- improved UDDF and divelogs.de support
- generalized import dialog
- much improved consistency for dialog boxes, keyboard shortcuts, etc
- improved error handling when downloading from divecomputer
- export an HTML world map with dive sites
- make backups before overwriting XML files
- don't display unused cylinders in the equipment tab (this can be turned
  off and the old behavior restored in the preferences)
- lots of code cleanup, style fixes, improved consistency
- improve Qt5 support (but there are still some visual oddities)
- many improvements to the build infrastructure (out of tree builds,
  ability to build without Marble, make WIP planner a config option)
- more than 50 bugs fixed
- new translation (Greek, British-English, Latvian, and Romanian)
- experimental "check for updates" feature (mostly for Windows and Mac)
- experimental undocumented alternative storage format


New in version 4.0.3 (compared to Subsurface 4.0.2):
----------------------------------------------------

- fixed unitinialized variable bug that caused errors downloading from
  divecomputers

New in version 4.0.2 (compared to Subsurface 4.0.1):
----------------------------------------------------

- fixed potential crash when importing dive data without dive computer
  model information
- improve parsing of equipment data; this now accepts localized units
  as well as input in units that are not the display units (so if you
  run Subsurface in metric, but went diving in a place where weights
  are in US Pounds (lbs), you can now enter the weight in lbs and
  Subsurface does the right thing)
- fix temperature conversion when downloading data from Uemis SDA
- improve autocompletion to always be case insensitive
- improve selection handling in the dive list
- include event data in libdivecomputer dump
- improve profiles generated for dives with no depth samples and no
  average depth

New in version 4.0.1 (compared to Subsurface 4.0):
--------------------------------------------------

- fixed several bugs handling non-ASCII text both in dive info text
  fields as well as in Windows file names
- added support for generating libdivecomputer log and dump files
- many improvements for import and export of other file formats
- XSLT files are built-in as resources, avoiding issues with not
  finding them
- support more GPS coordinate formats
- fixed several bugs around editing of manually entered dives
- fixed several bugs with entering data for weights and tanks
- increase the number of tracked weight systems to 6
- fixed font setting in preferences
- improved look and feel when running dark themes
- support older versions of Mac OS/X with default DMG (>= 10.5)
- enable https in Windows binaries

New in version 4.0 (compared to Subsurface 3.1):
------------------------------------------------

With version 4.0 the Subsurface team switched to a different UI
toolkit. This caused the need to do a complete rewrite of a large
chunk of the Subsurface code base. We decided to keep much of the
logic and core of the existing code around, but used the opportunity
for quite a bit of cleanup and many improvements.

The basic concepts are the same, most of the basic features are the
same, but trying to create a concise list of changes that summarizes
the more than 1600 commits that have gone in since version 3.1 seems a
daunting task.

Here are some of the highlights:

- new map widget with a spinning globe to visualize dive locations
- much more "native" look and feel under Windows and Mac
- ability to edit dives "in place": simply click on an entry in the
  Dive Notes or Equipment tabs to start editing
- more data about each dive is presented in the Dive Notes and can
  be edited without separate dialogs and without having to go through
  context menues
- graphical editor for dive profiles for manually added dives
- better information overlay for the dive profile
- addition of a "ruler" tool in the profile window that allows
  measuring of many properties between two points in the profile
- better tag system with both predefined user-specified free text tags
- better integration with divelogs.de (upload & download support)
- ability to show the user manual from within the application without
  a life internet connection and without opening the manual in an
  external browser window
- better statistics (with per-trip statistics available)

Known issues:

- Filter->Select Events is not implemented
- Dive planner has been disabled for now
- https support for divelogs.de on Windows is disabled



New in version 3.1 (compared to Subsurface 3.0.2):
--------------------------------------------------

- track tags for dives (things like 'boat', 'shore', 'deep', etc)
- enable filtering by tags
- ability to modify events from a context menu in the dive profile
  (this includes the ability to add gaschange events)
- direct export / upload to the divelogs.de online logbook
- import of Suunto DM4 files
- improved printout formatting and printer dialog
- support for color printing
- dive planning: add option for last stop at 6m/20ft
- added support for Heinrichs Weikamp OSTC3 and Suunto DX
- native support for the Shearwater Petrel (much faster download)
- various bug fixes



New in version 3.0.2 (compared to Subsurface 3.0.1):
----------------------------------------------------

This update was mainly triggered by a bug in the handling of pOâ‚‚
values read from CCR / rebreather dive computers. This bug can lead to
incorrect data being stored in the Subsurface XML file. Installing
Subsurface 3.0.2 and re-downloading the dives will correct the
incorrect data. In order to re-download the dives connect your dive
computer (this should only affect people with certain tec dive
computers like the Shearwater Petrel or Predator that store pOâ‚‚ values
read from a pOâ‚‚ sensor in their dive log), open the download dialog,
check the box "Force download of all dives" and download your
dives. After you save your data file the correct pOâ‚‚ data should be
stored in the samples.

If you are using one of those dive computers, have saved data files
with Subsurface 3.0 or 3.0.1 and have since deleted those dives from
your dive computers, please contact the developers as we also have an
experimental script that should be able to fix incorrect XML files -
but re-downloading the data is the much more reliable way to address
this issue.

In addition to this bug fix, 3.0.2 brings a number of other improvements:
 - A Portuguese localization of Subsurface was added.
 - Subsurface now remembers its window size and pane layout the next time
   it is started.
 - Several importers for data for third party dive software were improved.
 - Dives from the Heinrichs & Weikamp DR5 and from kenozooid can now be
   imported into Subsurface.
 - A crash with localized versions of Subsurface on Mac was resolved.
 - The map provider for the GPS maps is now configurable.
 - The layout of some dialog boxes was changed to improve usability on
   small screens.
 - It is now easier to edit date and time of existing dives (and you can
   now edit duration, maximum and average depth for dives that were
   manually entered).
 - Several small bugs were addressed.


New in version 3.0.1 (compared to Subsurface 3.0):
--------------------------------------------------

- Several bug fixes for importing log files from other divelog software;
  especially imports from DivingLog should work much better now, but
  also new importer functions for UDDF and UDCF
- Fixes for SAC calculation and gas volume estimates at high pressures
  (air and nitrox are NOT ideal gases in the physics sense)
- Added Help link to the online user manual
- Improved the user manual
- random other bug fixes


New in version 3.0 (compared to Subsurface 2.1):
------------------------------------------------

- Many new divecomputers supported, bugfixes for existing divecomputers
  - Cressi Leonardo, Seemann XP5, Mares Matrix, Mares Puck Pro, Mares
    Nemo Wide 2, Shearwater Petrel, Shearwater Predator, Aeris A300
    AI, Hollis DG03
  - significant improvements for the Heinrichs Weiskamp OSTC
- Significantly improved selection of divecomputers for direct download
- Map display of GPS locations of dives and ability to enter and edit those
- Improved automatic dive numbering
- Data overlay for profile plot (with additional statistics information)
- Zoom function for profile plot
- Dive planner
- Improved printing support
- Improved dive trip handling
- Support for downloading dives from multiple computers (so for example
  both your main and your backup computer)
- Added ability to import existing divelogs from Suunto DM3 (no manual
  unpacking needed anymore), MacDive and divelogs.de
- Lots of features to make tec divers happy:
  - Experimental deco calculation with optional display of a calculated
    ceiling (Buhlmann ZH16 with gradient factors)
  - Display of deco information from some divecomputers that support this
  - TriMix support
  - CCR support (fixed or variable setpoint, on dive computers that support
    this)
  - Optional pOâ‚‚, pNâ‚‚ and pHe graphs
  - CNS tracking for supported divecomputers
- Lots of bug fixes
