			Subsurface 4.0.2
			================

The Subsurface developer team is proud to announce the release of the
next minor update of Subsurface.

Subsurface is an open source divelog program that runs on Windows, Mac
and Linux.

With Subsurface the user can download dive information directly from a
large number of supported dive computers. Subsurface is able to track
single- and multi-tank dives using air, Nitrox or TriMix. It displays
a dive profile with all related information including air consumption
and alarms. It also allows logging of information like weights and
exposure protection used, dive masters and dive buddies, and enables
the user to rate dives and provide additional dive notes.

With Subsurface the user can track dive locations including GPS
coordinates (which can also be conveniently entered using a map
interface). Subsurface calculates a wide variety of statistics of the
user's diving and keeps track of information like the user's SAC rate,
partial pressures of O2, N2 and He, calculated deco information, and
many more.

Subsurface allows the user to print out a detailed log book including
dive profiles and other relevant information. The program is localized
in about 20 languages and well supported by an active developer
community.

One of the major strengths of Subsurface is its support of a wide range
of dive computers (most common dive computers are supported with the help
of libdivecomputer); a detailed list is in the SupportedDivecomputers.txt
file. Subsurface can also import existing dive logs from several sources
including MacDive, Suunto DM3/DM4, JDiveLog and divelogs.de. Another
strength is its ability to visualize the depth profile (and, if
available, the tank pressure curve) in very innovative ways that give
the user additional information on relative velocity (and momentary
air consumption) during the dive through the coloring of the graphs.

New in version 4.0.2 (compared to Subsurface 4.0.1):
----------------------------------------------------

- fixed potential crash when importing dive data without dive computer
  model information
- improve parsing of equipment data; this now accepts localized units
  as well as input in units that are not the display units (so if you
  run Subsurface in metric, but went diving in a place where weights
  are in US Pounds (lbs), you can now enter the weight in lbs and
  Subsurface does the right thing)
- fix temperature conversion when downloading data from Uemis SDA
- improve autocompletion to always be case insensitive
- improve selection handling in the dive list
- include event data in libdivecomputer dump
- improve profiles generated for dives with no depth samples and no
  average depth

New in version 4.0.1 (compared to Subsurface 4.0):
--------------------------------------------------

- fixed several bugs handling non-ASCII text both in dive info text
  fields as well as in Windows file names
- added support for generating libdivecomputer log and dump files
- many improvements for import and export of other file formats
- XSLT files are built-in as resources, avoiding issues with not
  finding them
- support more GPS coordinate formats
- fixed several bugs around editing of manually entered dives
- fixed several bugs with entering data for weights and tanks
- increase the number of tracked weight systems to 6
- fixed font setting in preferences
- improved look and feel when running dark themes
- support older versions of Mac OS/X with default DMG (>= 10.5)
- enable https in Windows binaries

New in version 4.0 (compared to Subsurface 3.1):
------------------------------------------------

With version 4.0 the Subsurface team switched to a different UI
toolkit. This caused the need to do a complete rewrite of a large
chunk of the Subsurface code base. We decided to keep much of the
logic and core of the existing code around, but used the opportunity
for quite a bit of cleanup and many improvements.

The basic concepts are the same, most of the basic features are the
same, but trying to create a concise list of changes that summarizes
the more than 1600 commits that have gone in since version 3.1 seems a
daunting task.

Here are some of the highlights:

- new map widget with a spinning globe to visualize dive locations
- much more "native" look and feel under Windows and Mac
- ability to edit dives "in place": simply click on an entry in the
  Dive Notes or Equipment tabs to start editing
- more data about each dive is presented in the Dive Notes and can
  be edited without separate dialogs and without having to go through
  context menues
- graphical editor for dive profiles for manually added dives
- better information overlay for the dive profile
- addition of a "ruler" tool in the profile window that allows
  measuring of many properties between two points in the profile
- better tag system with both predefined user-specified free text tags
- better integration with divelogs.de (upload & download support)
- ability to show the user manual from within the application without
  a life internet connection and without opening the manual in an
  external browser window
- better statistics (with per-trip statistics available)

Known issues:

- Filter->Select Events is not implemented
- Dive planner has been disabled for now
- https support for divelogs.de on Windows is disabled



New in version 3.1 (compared to Subsurface 3.0.2):
--------------------------------------------------

- track tags for dives (things like 'boat', 'shore', 'deep', etc)
- enable filtering by tags
- ability to modify events from a context menu in the dive profile
  (this includes the ability to add gaschange events)
- direct export / upload to the divelogs.de online logbook
- import of Suunto DM4 files
- improved printout formatting and printer dialog
- support for color printing
- dive planning: add option for last stop at 6m/20ft
- added support for Heinrichs Weikamp OSTC3 and Suunto DX
- native support for the Shearwater Petrel (much faster download)
- various bug fixes



New in version 3.0.2 (compared to Subsurface 3.0.1):
----------------------------------------------------

This update was mainly triggered by a bug in the handling of pO2
values read from CCR / rebreather dive computers. This bug can lead to
incorrect data being stored in the Subsurface XML file. Installing
Subsurface 3.0.2 and re-downloading the dives will correct the
incorrect data. In order to re-download the dives connect your dive
computer (this should only affect people with certain tec dive
computers like the Shearwater Petrel or Predator that store pO2 values
read from a pO2 sensor in their dive log), open the download dialog,
check the box "Force download of all dives" and download your
dives. After you save your data file the correct pO2 data should be
stored in the samples.

If you are using one of those dive computers, have saved data files
with Subsurface 3.0 or 3.0.1 and have since deleted those dives from
your dive computers, please contact the developers as we also have an
experimental script that should be able to fix incorrect XML files -
but re-downloading the data is the much more reliable way to address
this issue.

In addition to this bug fix, 3.0.2 brings a number of other improvements:
 - A Portuguese localization of Subsurface was added.
 - Subsurface now remembers its window size and pane layout the next time
   it is started.
 - Several importers for data for third party dive software were improved.
 - Dives from the Heinrichs & Weikamp DR5 and from kenozooid can now be
   imported into Subsurface.
 - A crash with localized versions of Subsurface on Mac was resolved.
 - The map provider for the GPS maps is now configurable.
 - The layout of some dialog boxes was changed to improve usability on
   small screens.
 - It is now easier to edit date and time of existing dives (and you can
   now edit duration, maximum and average depth for dives that were
   manually entered).
 - Several small bugs were addressed.


New in version 3.0.1 (compared to Subsurface 3.0):
--------------------------------------------------

- Several bug fixes for importing log files from other divelog software;
  especially imports from DivingLog should work much better now, but
  also new importer functions for UDDF and UDCF
- Fixes for SAC calculation and gas volume estimates at high pressures
  (air and nitrox are NOT ideal gases in the physics sense)
- Added Help link to the online user manual
- Improved the user manual
- random other bug fixes


New in version 3.0 (compared to Subsurface 2.1):
------------------------------------------------

- Many new divecomputers supported, bugfixes for existing divecomputers
  - Cressi Leonardo, Seemann XP5, Mares Matrix, Mares Puck Pro, Mares
    Nemo Wide 2, Shearwater Petrel, Shearwater Predator, Aeris A300
    AI, Hollis DG03
  - significant improvements for the Heinrichs Weiskamp OSTC

- Support for downloading dives from multiple computers (so for example
  both your main and your backup computer)
- Added ability to import existing divelogs from Suunto DM3 (no manual
  unpacking needed anymore), MacDive and divelogs.de
- Lots of features to make tec divers happy:
  - Experimental deco calculation with optional display of a calculated
    ceiling (Buhlmann ZH16 with gradient factors)
  - Display of deco information from some divecomputers that support this
  - TriMix support
  - CCR support (fixed or variable setpoint, on dive computers that support
    this)
  - Optional pO2, pN2 and pHe graphs
  - CNS tracking for supported divecomputers
- Lots of bug fixes
