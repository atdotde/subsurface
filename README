This is the README file for the 3.9.2 Beta version of Subsurface.

After the release of Subsurface 3.1 we merged the Qt branch into
master and started developing the Qt port of Subsurface in the master
branch. At this stage the Qt version has reached mostly functional parity
with version 3.1. There are some minor items still missing, but in others
it far surpasses what was available in 3.1

The developers feel that this version is quite stable and we think we are
close to a final release of Subsurface 4.0. There are a small handful of
known bugs - please check trac.hohndel.org.

Much as we are optimistic about 3.9.2, please do not use this on your "real"
dive log files unless you have good backups. Check the XML files after you
make changes to make sure that what you saved on disk reasonably resembles
what you intended to do.

Please check the ReleaseNotes.txt for known issues.

And most importantly, please provide us with feedback.



Everything below has not been updated since 3.1.1

Subsurface - an Open Source Divelog
===================================

Subsurface is an open source divelog program that runs on Windows, Mac
and Linux.

With Subsurface the user can download dive information directly from a
large number of supported dive computers. Subsurface is able to track
single- and multi-tank dives using air, Nitrox or TriMix. It displays
a dive profile with all related information including air consumption
and alarms. It also allows logging of information like weights and
exposure protection used, dive masters and dive buddies and enables
the user to rate dives and provide additional dive notes.

With Subsurface the user can track dive locations including GPS
coordinates (which can also be conveniently entered using a map
interface). Subsurface calculates a wide variety of statistics of the
user's diving and keeps track of information like the user's SAC rate,
partial pressures of O2, N2 and He, calculated deco information, and
many more.

Subsurface allows the user to print out a detailed log book including
dive profiles and other relevant information. The program is localized
in more than a dozen languages and well supported by an active
developer community.

One of the major strengths of Subsurface is its support of a wide range
of dive computers (most common dive computers are supported with the help
of libdivecomputer); a detailed list is at
http://subsurface.hohndel.org/documentation/supported-dive-computers).
Subsurface can also import existing dive logs from several sources
including MacDive, Suunto DM3/DM4, JDiveLog and divelogs.de. Another
strength is its ability to visualize the depth profile (and, if
available, the tank pressure curve) in very innovative ways that give
the user additional information on relative velocity (and momentary
air consumption) during the dive through the coloring of the graphs.

The latest public version is Subsurface 3.1, released in May of 2013.

Subsurface can be found at http://subsurface.hohndel.org

You can get the sources to the latest development version from the git
repository:

git clone git://subsurface.hohndel.org/subsurface.git .

You can also browse the sources via gitweb at git.hohndel.org

If you want the latest release (instead of the bleeding edge
development version) you can either get this via

git checkout v3.1  (or whatever the last release is)

if you have already cloned the git repository as shown above or you
can get a tar ball from

http://subsurface.hohndel.org/downloads/Subsurface-3.1.tgz

Usage:
======

Install and start from the desktop (or you can run it locally from the
build directory).

./subsurface

You can give a data file as command line argument, or Subsurface picks a
default file for you when started from the desktop or without an argument.

If you have a dive computer supported by libdivecomputer, you can just
select "Download from Divecomputer" from the Log menu, tell it what dive
computer you have (and where it is connected if you need to), and hit
"OK".

-------------

There is a mailing list for developers: subsurface@hohndel.org
Go to http://lists.hohndel.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/subsurface
to subscribe.

If you want to contribute code, please either send signed-off patches or
a pull request with signed-off commits.  If you don't sign off on them,
we will not accept them. This means adding a line that says
"Signed-off-by: Name <email>" at the end of each commit, indicating that
you wrote the code and have the right to pass it on as an open source
patch.

See: http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.0/user-signedoffby.html

Also, please write good git commit messages.  A good commit message
looks like this:

	Header line: explaining the commit in one line

	Body of commit message is a few lines of text, explaining things
	in more detail, possibly giving some background about the issue
	being fixed, etc etc.

	The body of the commit message can be several paragraphs, and
	please do proper word-wrap and keep columns shorter than about
	74 characters or so. That way "git log" will show things
	nicely even when it's indented.

	Reported-by: whoever-reported-it
	Signed-off-by: Your Name <youremail@yourhost.com>

where that header line really should be meaningful, and really should be
just one line.  That header line is what is shown by tools like gitk and
shortlog, and should summarize the change in one readable line of text,
independently of the longer explanation.

A bit of Subsurface history:
----------------------------

In fall of 2011, when a forced lull in kernel development gave him an
opportunity to start on a new endeavor, Linus Torvalds decided to tackle
his frustration with the lack of decent divelog software on Linux.

Subsurface is the result of the work of him and a team of developers since
then. It now supports Linux, Windows and MacOS and allows data import from
a large number of dive computers and several existing divelog programs. It
provides advanced visualization of the key information provided by a
modern dive computer and allows the user to track a wide variety of data
about their diving.
