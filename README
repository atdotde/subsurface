This is the README file for Subsurface 4.0.

After the release of Subsurface 3.1 we merged the Qt branch into
master and started developing the Qt port of Subsurface in the master
branch. At this stage the Qt version has by and large reached
functional parity with version 3.1; two notable features are missing:
the filter by event type and the dive planner. The user experience and
look and feel on the other hand far surpass what was available in 3.1

As always in a massive rewrite like this, there are still a small
handful of known bugs and issues - please check ReleaseNotes.tzt and
our bug tracker at trac.hohndel.org.

The latest public version is Subsurface 4.0, released in December of 2013.

Subsurface can be found at http://subsurface.hohndel.org

You can get the sources to the latest development version from the git
repository:

git clone git://subsurface.hohndel.org/subsurface.git .

You can also browse the sources via gitweb at git.hohndel.org

If you want the latest release (instead of the bleeding edge
development version) you can either get this via

git checkout v4.0  (or whatever the last release is)

if you have already cloned the git repository as shown above or you
can get a tar ball from

http://subsurface.hohndel.org/downloads/Subsurface-4.0.tgz


Basic Usage:
============

Install and start from the desktop (or you can run it locally from the
build directory).

./subsurface

You can give a data file as command line argument, or Subsurface picks a
default file for you when started from the desktop or without an argument.

If you have a dive computer supported by libdivecomputer, you can just
select "Import from Divecomputer" from the "Import" menu, select which
dive computer you have (and where it is connected if you need to), and
hit "OK".

The latest list of supported dive computers can be found in the file
SupportedDivecomputers.txt

Much more detailed end user instructions can be found from inside
Subsurface by selecting Help (typically F1). When building from source
this is also available as Documentation/user-manual.html


Contributing:
=============

There is a mailing list for developers: subsurface@hohndel.org
Go to http://lists.hohndel.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/subsurface
to subscribe.

If you want to contribute code, please either send signed-off patches or
a pull request with signed-off commits.  If you don't sign off on them,
we will not accept them. This means adding a line that says
"Signed-off-by: Name <email>" at the end of each commit, indicating that
you wrote the code and have the right to pass it on as an open source
patch.

See: http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.0/user-signedoffby.html

Also, please write good git commit messages.  A good commit message
looks like this:

	Header line: explaining the commit in one line

	Body of commit message is a few lines of text, explaining things
	in more detail, possibly giving some background about the issue
	being fixed, etc etc.

	The body of the commit message can be several paragraphs, and
	please do proper word-wrap and keep columns shorter than about
	74 characters or so. That way "git log" will show things
	nicely even when it's indented.

	Reported-by: whoever-reported-it
	Signed-off-by: Your Name <youremail@yourhost.com>

where that header line really should be meaningful, and really should be
just one line.  That header line is what is shown by tools like gitk and
shortlog, and should summarize the change in one readable line of text,
independently of the longer explanation.


A bit of Subsurface history:
============================

In fall of 2011, when a forced lull in kernel development gave him an
opportunity to start on a new endeavor, Linus Torvalds decided to tackle
his frustration with the lack of decent divelog software on Linux.

Subsurface is the result of the work of him and a team of developers since
then. It now supports Linux, Windows and MacOS and allows data import from
a large number of dive computers and several existing divelog programs. It
provides advanced visualization of the key information provided by a
modern dive computer and allows the user to track a wide variety of data
about their diving.

In fall of 2012 Dirk Hohndel took over as maintainer of Subsurface
